By Jessica Cherner Published: Sep 16, 2022 6:24 PM EDT Save Article West Elm Every item on this page was hand-picked by a House Beautiful editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. To anyone who argues that bedside tables aren’t essential bedroom furniture , not only do we beg to differ, but we’ve rounded up a list of the best nightstands to convince you otherwise. We don’t want to be dramatic, but there's nothing worse than waking up in the middle of the night with a parched throat and realizing that you have to actually stand up and walk to the kitchen to quench your thirst. Ideally, there’s a full glass within arm’s reach. Enter: nightstands. The thing about these clever furniture pieces is that they don’t necessarily have to be a nightstand to get the job done. You can opt for a dresser , end table, or even an ottoman depending on how low-profile your bed is. All a nightstand needs in order to serve its purpose is a flat surface for your phone, an accessory, and, of course, a glass of water. Like any piece of furniture , a nightstand can run in the thousands, but it can also cost less than $100 without skimping on style. Think a black oak, open-shelf bedside table for just $34 or a sleek, white hutch with its own charging station for $99. Best Overall CREATIVELAND Bedside End Table Read more Most Versatile West Elm Fluted Nightstand Read more Most Stylish Sand & Stable Nador Drawer Nightstand Read more All in all, a nightstand is a must. And since they aren’t exactly niche, there are loads to choose from. Scroll on, shop our must-have list for the easiest bedroom transformation ever. We guarantee adding a couple of these end tables will make a life-changing difference ! Best Overall CREATIVELAND Bedside End Table Now 23% Off $99 at Amazon Credit: CREATIVELAND Pros Compact Has a drawer Affordable Cons Requires assembly Not only does this nightstand have plenty of shelf space for displaying all of your books and a drawer for hiding items that aren't aesthetically pleasing, it also boasts rattan detailing for a natural look. Dimensions 18.9" H x 15.75" W x 15.75" D Materials Wood and rattan Assembly Yes Most Versatile West Elm Fluted Nightstand $189 at West Elm Credit: West Elm Pros Affordable Available in multiple sizes Available in multiple colors Cons Heavy This is my personal nightstand and I designed my whole bedroom around it. It’s simultaneously classic and a statement piece. The fluted nightstand is available in two sizes and four colors, all of which are earthy and rich. I have the white one, a bright matte shade that instantly brightens up my space. Dimensions 17.7" H x 13" D and 20.5" H x 16" D Materials Earthenware Assembly No Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Stylish Sand & Stable Nador Drawer Nightstand Now 16% Off $200 at Wayfair Credit: Wayfair Pros Compact Includes storage Cons Untreated wood Cane, which is just woven rattan , swept through the United States during most of the 70s, but it’s made a big comeback in recent years. Traditionally reserved for outdoor furniture , cane is finally making its way inside, giving us a good excuse to snatch all of the beachy finds we can. Dimensions 24.4” H x 18” W x 15” D Materials Wood Assembly Minimal assembly required Most Innovative ADORNEVE Nightstand with Charging Station Now 30% Off $70 at Amazon Credit: Amazon Pros Comes with charging station Affordable Cons Must be plugged into outlet For those whose phone chargers are just out of reach, rejoice. There's a nightstand with a charging station so that you never need to get out of bed to peep your text messages in the middle of the night. It’s made even more practical with three drawers. Dimensions 26.8" H x 13.8" W x 17.7" D Materials Shaving board Assembly Yes Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Charming Anthropologie Zagora Tasseled Nightstand $498 at Anthropologie Credit: Anthropologie Pros Hand-carved Lacquered for easy cleaning Cons Expensive When it comes to furniture, Anthropologie never lets us down . We’re loving the Zagora tasseled nightstand, which is handcrafted with beveled edges and sealed in lacquer so that you don’t have to be too precious with it. That said, you may still want to use a coaster. Dimensions 28" H x 26" W x 17.5" D Materials Tropical hardwood and brass Assembly No Most Low Maintenance Crate & Barrel Batten White Oak Floating Nightstand $249 at Crate & Barrel Credit: Crate & Barrel Pros Minimal Stackable Cons On backorder At first glance, this white oak design may look more like a shoe box than a nightstand, but picture it mounted to your wall beside your bed. Floating shelves like this one work best in small spaces with little floor space to spare. And unlike traditional nightstands, you can horizontally stack these for extra storage. Dimensions 8.5" H x 23.54" W x 11.73" D Materials Poplar, hardwood and oak Assembly Yes Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Affordable Mainstays Classic Open Shelf Nightstand Now 13% Off $34 at Walmart Credit: Walmart Pros Under $40 Available in multiple colors Cons No hidden storage Because all of your wares are on full display, we’d suggest opting for an open-shelf nightstand only if you’re a minimalist or highly organized. This simple option, available in six finishes, is on sale for just $34. Dimensions 20.3" H x 15.7" W x 15.7" D Materials Wood Assembly Yes Most Coastal Serena & Lily Driftway Nightstand $1,298 at Serena and Lily Credit: Serena & Lily Pros Lacquered for easy cleaning Available in multiple colors Cons Expensive Hand-wrapped in linen, the Parsons-style nightstand from Serena & Lily is more luxe than any traditional nightstand needs to be, but we’re here for it. If we lost you at “ linen ,” a traditionally delicate fabric, let us win you back. It’s been treated with five coats of matte lacquer, so it’s not quite as delicate as it may look. Dimensions 24” H x 22” W x 18” D Materials Linen, brass, and wood Assembly No Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best for Small Spaces Pottery Barn Garrett Flip Top C-Table Nightstand $499 at Pottery Barn Credit: Pottery Barn Pros Expandable Compact Cons Small Ideal for small spaces , this folding night table is as sleek and as modern as design gets. Simply slide the muted brass base under your bed and bring the onyx top, which flips open and nearly triples in size, as close to you as you want. We’re suckers for clever and innovative furniture, and this piece from Pottery Barn is at the top of our list. Dimensions 31"  H x 34" W x 13" D Materials Onyx and brass Assembly No Best Design Throwback Opalhouse Woven Drawer Nightstand $30 at Target Credit: Target Pros Ships within three business days Ideal for small spaces Cons Low-profile Another chic rattan find, this low-profile , two-drawer gem is the brainchild of Opalhouse and Jungalow, which is arguably one of the best collabs we’ve seen. Clever details, including the curved handles and tiered legs, are a not-so-subtle not to the bohemian-style furniture of the 60s , making this nightstand one of our favorites. Dimensions 22”  H x 20” W x 18” D Materials Wood Assembly No Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Iconic Middlebrook Designs Mid Century Nightstand $159 at Overstock Credit: Overstock Pros Available in multiple finishes Versatile Affordable Cons Veneer prone to blemishes Reminiscent of Vittorio Dassi’s 50s design but a mere fraction of the price, we can't help obsessing over this $160 alternative. Aside from price, the downside to the original was that the Italian furniture maker made his iconic nightstands in only one kind of wood, whereas the affordable dupe is available in five finishes, including both black and white. Dimensions 24" H x 20" W x 14” D Materials Pine Assembly Yes Best Space-Saver Urban Outfitters Zion Acrylic Side Table $199 at Urban Outfitters Credit: Urban Outfitters Pros Easy to move Versatile Cons Scratches easily Our go-to hack for saving space is swapping out opaque furniture with something acrylic. It may not literally save space, but acrylic furniture gives the illusion of space since it's completely transparent. See-through furniture (like this minimalist nightstand) is definitely the easiest way to fake a bigger bedroom. Dimensions 14” H x 14” W x 14” D Materials Acrylic Assembly No Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Floating Woodendot Alba L Bedside Table $324 at 1stDibs Credit: 1stDibs Pros Hidden storage Hand-made Cons Ships from Europe You already know we love a floating shelf —especially one with hidden storage and a modern design. The Alba bedside table has both. Mount it to your wall and hide your favorite guilty pleasure page turner behind the taller of the two wood ovals. No matter the look of your space, the Alba will instantly elevate it. Dimensions 24.41” H x 21.66” W x 16.15” D Materials Plywood Assembly No Most Unique Yet Design Studio Tombul Nightstand $679 at revivalrugs.com Credit: Revival Rugs Pros Lacquered for easy cleaning Customizable Cons Expensive Revival Rugs is famous for its collection of eye-catching floor coverings, but did you know that it also sells a handful of funky furniture? We’ve got our eye on the low-profile Yet Design Studio nightstand, a whimsically curved piece glazed in a silk matte lacquer. What’s more, you can customize it to your exact specifications! Dimensions 19.7” H x 17.7” W x 21.7” D Assembly No Materials Raw MDF and silk matte lacquer Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Simple FUFU & GAGA Furniture Two-Drawer White Nightstands $91 at Home Depot Credit: The Home Depot Pros Affordable Versatile Hidden storage Cons Stains easily We’ve all heard the saying, “the simplest solution is often the correct one,” and such is definitely the case when it comes to this charming two-drawer nightstand. If you’re in a bind and can’t pick a style, you really can’t go wrong with a classic silhouette. The open shelf doesn’t hurt either. Dimensions 26.1” H x 19.6” W x 15.7” D Materials Wood Assembly Yes What are the different types of nightstands? House Beautiful The great thing about a nightstand is that it can also be an end table . There are no rules (or specific types) of nightstands for it to serve its purpose as a place to put your phone while you sleep. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below How tall should a nightstand be? A nightstand should be the same height as your bed . That said, if it's slightly taller or shorter, that's okay. If it's more than several inches taller, you'll be reaching too high for your things. Why trust us? Jessica Cherner is House Beautiful 's Associate Shopping Editor and even though she lives in New York City, where space is limited, she scoured the Internet for two perfect nightstands, and is happy to share her research.

Jump to: Delivery and Install Saatva Rx Performance Review Saatva Rx Pricing and Sizing Pros and Cons How the Saatva Rx Has Held Up Over Time My Final Verdict Saatva Rx Mattress FAQs Buying my first mattress was a core memory. Like many, I had spent the early years of my life sleeping on mattresses others had given to me: my parents, my university, or former tenants who didn't want to schlep their mattress to their next apartment. So when it was finally time to fork up my own cash to buy a new mattress, I went with an affordable, Live Better Award-winning option from Zinus . I was super happy with my purchase for years until I suffered from a running injury in 2022. I developed sciatica and found myself struggling to sleep on my once beloved bed-in-a-box mattress. I began seeing a chiropractor for treatment, and he recommended Saatva's Classic Mattress to help alleviate my pain. I was familiar with the brand as it's tested and approved by our editors , but like my first foray into mattress buying, the prices were still a bit jarring. I let the mattress sit in my cart for weeks while trying to convince myself I didn't really need it, but life has its way of surprising you beyond your wildest dreams. Saatva  Rx Mattress Now 15% Off $2,801 at Saatva About a month after my chiropractor suggested Saatva, I started a new job as Deputy Digital Editor at House Beautiful and was asked to review the Saatva Rx : The brand's first mattress "designed for sleepers with chronic back and joint conditions." (You really can't make this stuff up.) And despite my former hesitation to splurge on a high-quality mattress, now that I've slept on the Rx for a year, I can confidently say you can't put a price on pain relief. Delivery and Install Unlike many internet brands, Saatva mattresses are proudly "never stuffed in a box." They are made to order, and the brand offers a free white glove delivery service . The team reached out via email a few days before the delivery date to provide a four-hour window and gave me a heads-up call 15 minutes ahead of arrival. Despite having a difficult space to navigate, the two-man delivery team worked swiftly to remove my Zinus mattress and replace it with the new Rx. The entire installation process took less than 10 minutes. Related Story Everything You Need to Know About Nolah Mattresses Saatva Rx Performance Review The 15-inch Rx mattress has seven layers and is plush but very supportive . The top layer is made with hypoallergenic cotton and treated with Saatva's exclusive Guardin™ botanical antimicrobial treatment to keep your mattress mold-free—a standard across all of the brand's models. But what separates the Rx is its extra layers of pressure-relieving support. The Patented Lumbar Zone® Quilting, which offers more support in the center third of the mattress, helps to align your spine while you sleep. This feature works in tandem with the layer of gel-infused memory foam to support your lower back while you're sleeping. There is also a second high-density foam layer and a layer of 1,628 flexible, 1-inch micro-coils (in the Queen model) to cradle your body and relieve pressure points. All of this is stacked on top of the "groundbreaking" Therapeutic Support Core, which is made up of foam-wrapped coils that eliminate motion transfer, provide edge support, and offer pressure relief. Katelyn Lunders Firmness The Rx claims to be "best suited for side sleepers, but also great for back and combination sleepers who suffer from chronic back & joint conditions." As a combination sleeper with sciatica, I have found it very supportive, whether I sleep on my back or side. Thanks to the varied layers and materials, the firmness isn't one note like my former memory foam mattress. Each section of the Saatva Rx is catered to support a different part of your body, resulting in the feeling of being cradled, which I love. Edge Support I currently sleep alone, so I get to sleep smack dab in the middle of my Saatva Rx, but when I have shared the bed I experienced no issues with the edge support. Unlike some mattresses that will kind of roll you off as you attempt to get out of bed in the morning, the Saatva Rx holds steady. This is thanks to firm spring coils around the mattress's perimeter.  The coils provide support without sacrificing comfort due to the layer of foam on top of them. Motion Isolation The only motion in my bed most nights is my Chiweenie, and at 9 pounds, he isn't necessarily the best judge of the motion impact from shifting weight. That being said, I'm very impressed with the isolation, especially for a non-memory foam mattress. Despite the springs/coils, it holds very steady. Temperature Regulation I personally haven't experienced overheating from sleeping on the Saatva Rx, even in summer months, but it's worth noting that this mattress is not designed specifically for hot sleepers. The Saatva Rx does have cooling features, but if you're prone to night sweats, you might need to invest in a cooling mattress cover . Related Story The Top 20 Editor-Approved Luxury Sheets Saatva Rx Pricing and Sizing Although it's not the most expensive mattress on the market by a long shot, the Saatva Rx is an investment, but definitely one worth making if you suffer from chronic back and joint pain. The queen-sized mattress I tested retails for $3,295. However, Saatva constantly offers major deals, and if you only suffer from minor aches and pains, the Saatva Classic is a more affordable luxury alternative at $1,995. Plus, Saatva offers financing with Affirm at zero percent APR. Soumi Sarkar Pros and Cons Saatva Rx Mattress Now 15% Off $2,795 at Saatva Pros The firmness is just right. I've never felt more comfortable and supported while sleeping. I feel an improvement in my hip and lower back pain thanks to Saatva's body contouring and lumbar support. The white glove delivery is free and seamless. Saatva has a 365-day mattress trial! You can take a year to make sure the Rx is the right fit for you. Cons It's on the pricier side, but Saatva is known for its incredible deals! It's very unlikely you'll pay full price for your mattress. At 15 inches tall, the Rx sits higher than my former 12-inch mattress, so I had to purchase a new, king-sized duvet cover and insert to fully cover the queen-sized mattress. How the Saatva Rx Has Held Up Over Time I'm very happy to report that after one year of sleeping on the Saatva Rx, its performance is as strong as ever. I credit this to the mattress's luxury features, specifically the pocketed coils that provide sturdy support and prevent sagging over time. I recently took a two-week trip and felt the difference in my alignment from sleeping on another mattress. Once I returned to my Saatva Rx, I was sleeping soundly again, thanks to the many layers created for support and pain relief. The mattress is also still in mint condition after a year of sleeping on it with my dog, Oakley. I swear by this mattress protector , which saved my Saatva from ruin when he had a little accident a few months ago. My Final Verdict Saatva I will not claim this mattress cured my sciatica. (If only it were that simple!) But from the first night I slept on the Rx, my sleep life has improved drastically. Every fancy, patented feature that Saatva touts really does cradle your body into proper alignment. My hips often feel achy from sitting in meetings all day, and my previous mattress was offering no reprieve. Now, I actually find myself daydreaming about the sweet relief I know I'll feel at bedtime, and I wake up feeling well-rested and pain-free. The Rx has an incredible warranty , so I don't plan on purchasing another mattress in this lifetime, but I can now confidently say I would . So, if , like me, you've been suffering from chronic pain but are hesitant to shell out the cash for a luxury mattress, take this as your sign to splurge. Related Story These Luxury Mattresses Are Worth the Investment Saatva Rx Mattress FAQs How is the Saatva Rx delivered? Saatva offers free white glove delivery and also removes your old mattress free of charge. The process was seamless and much better than waiting for a bed-in-the-box mattress to inflate. Is the Saatva Rx compatible with an adjustable base? Yes, according to their site, the "Saatva Rx is compatible with most foundations, box springs, platform beds, and adjustable bases." It fit perfectly with my Zinus bed frame. Does the Saatva Rx come with a sleep trial? Yes, Saatva offers a 365-night home trial. If you opt to return or replace your mattress, you will need to pay a $99 pickup fee. Does the Saatva Rx come with a warranty? Saatva mattresses have a lifetime warranty. For the first two years, they will replace your mattress free of charge. Once you hit year three, they will repair and/or recover your mattress for a $149 fee.

Expand/Collapse Every Saatva mattress is crafted when you order it. We assemble all our mattresses in America with care and pride, using only the highest quality, globally sourced materials.

That’s it. + What makes the Saatva RX a good fit for people with chronic back pain? Expand/Collapse Saatva Rx is the first mattress on the market specifically designed to help sleepers dealing with serious & chronic joint and back conditions*. Its unique construction was designed to support, cradle, and contour to the body like no other mattress, which may help alleviate the daily aches & discomfort associated with these chronic conditions. *Please note that products and claims on this site and any Company linked sites have not been evaluated by any official institution and are not meant to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure any illness or disease nor do we promise or guarantee that it will give you relief from any injury or ailment. Can a mattress alleviate joint pain? Expand/Collapse Yes. Mattresses that contour and conform to the body’s curves help relieve pressure points, which helps improve circulation and alleviate joint pain. Saatva Rx is designed with multiple layers of body-contouring foams, including our proprietary Rx foam modules which relieve pressure points unlike any other type of mattress. What is the Therapeutic Support Core™ in Saatva Rx? Expand/Collapse Saatva Rx features a new & groundbreaking coil core system called the Therapeutic Support Core™. It's made up of our proprietary Rx Foam Module™ encased on top of individually pocketed coils. The result is a mattress that automatically adjusts and contours to every curve and movement better than any single-layer foam. This virtually eliminates pressure points in problem areas to allow for therapeutic relief and more restorative sleep. Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock? Expand/Collapse No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either plant-based flame barriers, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards. What flame retardants do Saatva mattresses use? Expand/Collapse The following Saatva mattresses use a natural, plant-based thistle flame retardant made of wood pulp bonded with a small amount of polyester: • Saatva Classic • Saatva HD • Saatva Youth • Memory Foam Hybrid (also contains natural wool as a flame retardant) The following Saatva mattresses use 100% GOTS certified organic New Zealand wool as a natural flame retardant: • Zenhaven Latex • Saatva Latex Hybrid • Crib Mattress Solaire adjustable firmness mattress uses Paladin, which is composed of flame retardant rayon fibers blended with polyester fibers. Contour5 memory foam mattress is covered on all six sides with a GREENGUARD®* Gold Certified natural flame barrier made of nontoxic cellulose fibers derived from tree byproducts. Bunk & Trundle mattress uses a nontoxic natural thistle & wool blend flame barrier. We do not use any harmful chemicals or sprays in any of our mattresses. Do I need to flip over or rotate my mattress regularly? Expand/Collapse Our Zenhaven, Latex Hybrid, Saatva HD, and Solaire mattresses do not need to be rotated from head to foot. This is due to the 5-zone alignment of the latex layer in those mattresses. Our other mattresses can be rotated. We recommend rotating the mattress after six months and then once a year after that. This will ensure that the surface of the mattress breaks in evenly. How do I clean my mattress? Expand/Collapse As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress. Tip: Adding a mattress pad over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly. For more mattress care tips, check out this blog . Is Saatva a bed in a box? Expand/Collapse No. Bed in a box (BIAB) mattresses are compressed, shrink-wrapped, folded, then rolled into a cardboard box for shipping. While this allows BIAB companies to save on freight costs, it takes a severe toll on the integrity of the foam mattress by breaking down the cell structure of the foams. It can also result in uneven firmness and sinking support in some areas, reducing the overall lifespan of the mattress. We believe your bed deserves better than being stuffed in a box. That’s why all Saatva mattresses come with FREE white glove delivery and in-home set up. We even take away your old mattress for free! How do I choose the right mattress height? Expand/Collapse Personal and aesthetic preferences are among the factors to consider when choosing the ideal mattress height/thickness. As a rule, mattress thickness alone is not an indicator of quality; that's more a function of mattress material and construction. A thicker mattress might be right for you if: • You have a larger body or are taller • You want to get on and off your bed with ease • Your bed frame or headboard requires a thicker/taller mattress A thinner mattress might be right for you if: • You don’t want to deal with a heavier mattress • You're shorter and don’t want to climb up into bed • You don’t want to purchase deep pocket or extra-deep pocket sheets Below are the heights (or thicknesses) of our Saatva mattresses: • Saatva Classic: 11.5" or 14.5" • Contour5: 12.5" • Latex Hybrid: 12" • Zenhaven: 10" • Saatva HD: 15.5" • Solaire: 13" • Memory Foam Hybrid: 11.5" • Rx: 15" If you place your mattress on a foundation, Saatva foundations are available in standard height (8.75") and low profile (4.75"). You can mix and match the thickness of a mattress and foundation to get the overall bed height that works best for you. Read our blog to learn more about finding the perfect mattress height for you. What are the weights of the mattresses? Expand/Collapse Saatva Classic: Twin: 11.5'' = 90 lbs. 14.5'' = 100 lbs. Twin XL: 11.5'' = 95 lbs. 14.5'' = 105 lbs. Full: 11.5'' = 100 lbs. 14.5'' = 110 lbs.

Expand/Collapse You can use your existing box spring or foundation if: • You purchased your box spring or foundation within the last seven years • Your existing box spring or foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support NOTE: Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD Foundation for adequate support. Saatva mattresses also work with platform beds, without the need for a foundation or box spring. Please make sure your existing platform bed has the following: • A solid, durable surface. If your platform has a slatted support system, make sure the slats are spaced less than 4" apart. If they're not, you can add a 1/2" thick piece of plywood or a bunkie board over the slats for optimal support. This extra layer of support is needed because Saatva mattresses are heavier due to their premium quality materials • A proper center support. This means you must have a center leg in the middle of your platform bed frame NOTE: When used with our dual-sided Zenhaven mattress, you must add a solid surface over platform slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board. If you have any questions, you can reach one of our sleep guides 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882. What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with? Expand/Collapse Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames. Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a bunkie board. Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that we strongly suggest pairing the Saatva HD with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support. Can I use an adjustable base with any mattress? Expand/Collapse Adjustable bases work with mattresses that are designed to flex without shifting the inner materials or weakening the structure. Saatva adjustable bases are compatible with the following Saatva mattresses: • Saatva Classic Luxury Hybrid Innerspring (11.5-inch height only) • Contour5 Cooling Memory Foam • Memory Foam Hybrid •Saatva Latex Hybrid •Zenhaven Latex •Solaire Adjustable •Saatva Rx If you'd like to pair your adjustable bed base with a non-Saatva mattress, contact the manufacturer to check if it's compatible with an adjustable base. What is a Split King mattress? Expand/Collapse A Split King mattress has the exact same dimensions as a king mattress, but made up of two separate Twin XL mattresses. This is a great option for those who have narrow entryways and staircases. Split King is also a great option for couples who want a king size mattress, but have different firmness preferences. Simply order two separate Twin XL mattresses in different comfort/firmness options. If ordering two different mattress styles, be mindful of the mattress heights for each mattress. Lastly, Split King mattresses are great paired with a Split King adjustable base so that each sleeper can control the head and foot incline/decline on their side independently from their partner. To order a Split King consisting of two different mattress types, add the two Twin XLs you want to your cart separately rather than selecting Split King size. If you need any assistance placing the order, give our sleep guides a call at 877-672-2882. What is CertiPUR-US®? Expand/Collapse Foams in the bedding or upholstered furniture that are CertiPUR-US® certified have been tested to meet their rigorous standards for emissions, content and durability. Specifically, the foam is: Made without formaldehyde Made without ozone depleters Made without phthalates regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Made without mercury, lead and other heavy metals Low VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million) Screened for relevant chemicals, including flame retardants, that are classified as carcinogens, mutagens or reproductive toxins and are harmful to human health *CertiPUR-US® is a registered trademark of the Alliance for Flexible Polyurethane Foam, Inc. What are the benefits of the Extend™ protection plan? Expand/Collapse The Extend™ protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage. This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva mattress warranty, such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse. Plans are effective from the day your mattress is delivered. For more info about Extend™ accident protection, check out our Extend™ page. Can I try your mattresses in person? Expand/Collapse Yes! Our Saatva Viewing Rooms are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life. What is on display to order at Saatva stores? Expand/Collapse All merchandise, including mattresses, select bed frames, and bedding products are on display to order in our Saatva Viewing Rooms across the country . Everything we have on display includes free white glove delivery or free ground shipping (for smaller goods like bedding). Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code. Pillows, bedding products, and rugs come with a 45-day free return policy. Mattress toppers come with a 180-night home trial. Mattresses and bedroom furniture come with our 365-night home trial*. If you decide to return your mattress or furniture within that home trial period, we will issue you a refund of your purchase price. The only cost to you is a $99 processing fee. * Excludes adjustable bases which are not eligible for returns or exchanges. What is white glove delivery? Expand/Collapse White glove delivery is the Saatva service standard and comes free with every mattress, bedroom furniture, and rug order. While our teams don't actually wear white gloves, we do all the work for you. We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge! Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code. Our bedroom furniture is also hand-delivered and assembled (if applicable) and bedroom rugs are delivered and set up in the room of your choice (rug area must be cleared of furniture by customer prior to delivery). You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service. *Note that our delivery teams won't take away the following items: • Waterbed bases • Standard metal bed frames • Sleep Number bases • Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs What if I need to return or exchange my mattress? Expand/Collapse If you aren't completely happy with your Saatva mattress or you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at 1-877-672-2882. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and issue a refund for the purchase price (taxes included) to your original method of payment if you are returning or start the exchange process. You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee and we’ll take care of the rest! Note that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7. We never resell returned mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them at cost to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery partners. Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress? Expand/Collapse Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage. Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882. What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it? Expand/Collapse All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month. Remember that your body will need some time to adjust to a brand new mattress. If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress. If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at 1-877-672-2882 and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you. Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more? Expand/Collapse We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount. Note that your cart will automatically apply the larger discount if there is a promotional sale on Saatva.com that is better than your ID.me discount. We also occasionally offer promotional sales for limited time periods on our products on Saatva.com and Saatva Viewing Rooms. To be one of the first to learn about our latest sales, sign up for our mailing list at our site footer or text BED to SAATVA (722882). You can unsubscribe at any time. Are your phone and store representatives on commission? Expand/Collapse No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way. What are the advantages of mattresses that are crafted in America? Expand/Collapse Mattresses crafted in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections. Knowing where your mattress is crafted makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattress manufacturers (like our network of 14 domestic factories) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products. Why am I being charged a mattress recycling fee? Expand/Collapse Laws in California, Connecticut, and Rhode Island require us to collect a small fee at checkout for every mattress, foundation, and adjustable base sold. The fees are used to fund recycling efforts in these states, as part of a program called Bye Bye Mattress. This program is operated by the Mattress Recycling Council, a nonprofit organization started by the mattress industry. The fees go toward the collection and processing of discarded mattresses and foundations. Per state laws, we have to collect the fee even if you don't plan on getting rid of your old mattress right now. Mattresses don't last forever—eventually, you'll have to discard your old one, and the fees will help cover the recycling costs when the time comes. About 20 million mattresses end up in U.S. landfills every year—that's about 55,000 per day—and that can take a toll on the environment. Since 2015, Bye Bye Mattress has helped reduce the number of mattresses that end up in landfills by recycling six million mattresses. Recycling a mattress has many benefits: It conserves resources, with recyclable materials such as foam padding, steel springs, and wooden frames being used to make new products; it creates recycling jobs; it reduces the number of illegally dumped mattresses; and it results in less reliance on landfills. + Don't just take our word for it 97.5% of customers surveyed said they would recommend Saatva to their friends and family* 91% of customers surveyed said they wake up more refreshed after sleeping on their Saatva than on their previous mattress* 95% of customers surveyed said that they are sleeping better on their Saatva than on their previous mattress* 93.1% of customers surveyed said that Saatva helped alleviate their NECK pain* 93.9% of customers surveyed said that Saatva helped alleviate their BACK pain* + Saatva has earned an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and 96% of Saatva customers are satisfied with their purchase**. See for yourself why we have the highest customer review ratings in the mattress industry. *From a recent Saatva customer satisfaction survey, which we conduct on a regular basis to ensure service, product, and overall quality standards. **Based off Saatva return rates. Customer Reviews Expand/Collapse Customer reviews Find the right bed setup for you Comfort starts from the ground up. The right bed base not only upgrades your sleep comfort, it can increase the lifespan of your mattress. Let's break down all of the options: Platform Bed Frame Standard Bed Frame + Foundation Foundation Adjustable Base This setup is great for: A sleek, low-profile look Those who prefer not to use a foundation or box spring Compatible with: Most mattresses NOTE: Must add a solid surface over the slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board, when used with the dual-sided Zenhaven Natural Latex Mattress. Shop platform bed frames Foundation vs. box spring: What’s the difference? A mattress foundation is a new & improved version of the old-fashioned box spring. Foundations use more stable wood support slats, while box springs use bouncier metal coils for support.

Expand/Collapse Every Saatva mattress is crafted when you order it. We assemble all our mattresses in America with care and pride, using only the highest quality, globally sourced materials.

Just select free mattress removal at checkout. 365-night home trial Expand/Collapse At Saatva, we never pressure you to make up your mind quickly. All of our mattresses come with a 365-night home trial, so you have plenty of time to decide whether it’s right for you. If at any point during your home trial you’re not satisfied, just give us a call and we’ll come pick up the mattress and refund your money, less a $99 processing fee to cover our cost of gas and labor for the pickup. That’s it. + What is an innerspring mattress? Expand/Collapse The innerspring mattress gets its name from the metal support coils (also called springs) that form the core of the bed. This common mattress type is known for its springy, responsive feel. A basic innerspring mattress will last you about 7-8 years. Keep in mind that material quality is a big contributing factor to how long an innerspring mattress will last. High-quality innerspring mattresses like our Saatva Classic can last 10-15 years with normal use. For more on mattress lifespans, check out our blog . Does coil count matter? Expand/Collapse Generally speaking, coil count is a good indicator of the overall comfort, support, and durability that a mattress offers. The number of coils in a mattress depends on its size. Typically, the standard for queen innerspring mattresses is 800 coils. The queen size of our Saatva Classic Innerspring Mattress features 884 individually pocketed coils that respond to your movements and limit motion transfer. What are the differences between innerspring and foam mattresses? Expand/Collapse The main difference between an innerspring mattress and a foam mattress comes down to the materials. An innerspring has a core support system made of coiled metal springs, while a foam mattress is made up of layers of polyurethane or viscoelastic (memory) foams. Memory foam mattresses generally offer a body-hugging feel. Innerspring mattresses generally have a bouncy, springy feel. While both mattress types have a lot of inherent differences, the choice between the two really comes down to individual preferences. That's why a great in-home trial period (like our 365-day home trial) is so crucial to making the most confident choice in your next mattress. What are individually wrapped coil innerspring mattresses? Expand/Collapse This type of innerspring mattress features individually wrapped metal spring coils. The two main advantages to individually wrapped coils are: 1) they conform and respond to your curves better than open coils and 2) they limit motion transfer because the coils move independently. How many coils are inside the Saatva Classic? Expand/Collapse The coil count varies by size: TWIN: Pocketed coils: 512 Support coils (base): 240 TOTAL: 752 TWIN XL: Pocketed coils: 544 Support coils(base): 260 TOTAL: 804 FULL: Pocketed coils: 704 Support coils (base): 336 TOTAL: 1,040 QUEEN: Pocketed coils: 884 Support coils (base): 416 TOTAL: 1,300 KING & SPLIT KING: Pocketed coils: 1,088 Support coils (base): 520 TOTAL: 1,608 CAL KING & SPLIT CAL KING: Pocketed coils: 1,088 Support coils (base): 520 TOTAL: 1,608 Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock? Expand/Collapse No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either plant-based flame barriers, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards. What flame retardants do Saatva mattresses use? Expand/Collapse The following Saatva mattresses use a natural, plant-based thistle flame retardant made of wood pulp bonded with a small amount of polyester: • Saatva Classic • Saatva HD • Saatva Youth • Memory Foam Hybrid (also contains natural wool as a flame retardant) The following Saatva mattresses use 100% GOTS certified organic New Zealand wool as a natural flame retardant: • Zenhaven Latex • Saatva Latex Hybrid • Crib Mattress Solaire adjustable firmness mattress uses Paladin, which is composed of flame retardant rayon fibers blended with polyester fibers. Contour5 memory foam mattress is covered on all six sides with a GREENGUARD®* Gold Certified natural flame barrier made of nontoxic cellulose fibers derived from tree byproducts. Bunk & Trundle mattress uses a nontoxic natural thistle & wool blend flame barrier. We do not use any harmful chemicals or sprays in any of our mattresses. Do I need to flip over or rotate my mattress regularly? Expand/Collapse Our Zenhaven, Latex Hybrid, Saatva HD, and Solaire mattresses do not need to be rotated from head to foot. This is due to the 5-zone alignment of the latex layer in those mattresses. Our other mattresses can be rotated. We recommend rotating the mattress after six months and then once a year after that. This will ensure that the surface of the mattress breaks in evenly. How do I clean my mattress? Expand/Collapse As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress. Tip: Adding a mattress pad over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly. For more mattress care tips, check out this blog . What is the best mattress for back pain? Expand/Collapse Picking the right mattress to help ease back pain starts with assessing your typical sleep position, then choosing a mattress firmness that best supports you in that position. Saatva mattresses are the only ones with patented Lumbar Zone® Technology. That means every Saatva mattress is designed with dedicated lumbar support at the center third of the mattress where you need it most. Benefits of this lumbar zone support include better spinal alignment, circulation, and pressure relief. Is Saatva a bed in a box? Expand/Collapse No. Bed in a box (BIAB) mattresses are compressed, shrink-wrapped, folded, then rolled into a cardboard box for shipping. While this allows BIAB companies to save on freight costs, it takes a severe toll on the integrity of the foam mattress by breaking down the cell structure of the foams. It can also result in uneven firmness and sinking support in some areas, reducing the overall lifespan of the mattress. We believe your bed deserves better than being stuffed in a box. That’s why all Saatva mattresses come with FREE white glove delivery and in-home set up. We even take away your old mattress for free! What flame retardants do Saatva mattresses use? Expand/Collapse The following Saatva mattresses use a natural, plant-based thistle flame retardant made of wood pulp bonded with a small amount of polyester: • Saatva Classic • Saatva HD • Saatva Youth • Memory Foam Hybrid (also contains natural wool as a flame retardant) The following Saatva mattresses use 100% GOTS certified organic New Zealand wool as a natural flame retardant: • Zenhaven Latex • Saatva Latex Hybrid • Crib Mattress Solaire adjustable firmness mattress uses Paladin, which is composed of flame retardant rayon fibers blended with polyester fibers. Contour5 memory foam mattress is covered on all six sides with a GREENGUARD®* Gold Certified natural flame barrier made of nontoxic cellulose fibers derived from tree byproducts. Bunk & Trundle mattress uses a nontoxic natural thistle & wool blend flame barrier. We do not use any harmful chemicals or sprays in any of our mattresses. How do I choose the right mattress height? Expand/Collapse Personal and aesthetic preferences are among the factors to consider when choosing the ideal mattress height/thickness. As a rule, mattress thickness alone is not an indicator of quality; that's more a function of mattress material and construction. A thicker mattress might be right for you if: • You have a larger body or are taller • You want to get on and off your bed with ease • Your bed frame or headboard requires a thicker/taller mattress A thinner mattress might be right for you if: • You don’t want to deal with a heavier mattress • You're shorter and don’t want to climb up into bed • You don’t want to purchase deep pocket or extra-deep pocket sheets Below are the heights (or thicknesses) of our Saatva mattresses: • Saatva Classic: 11.5" or 14.5" • Contour5: 12.5" • Latex Hybrid: 12" • Zenhaven: 10" • Saatva HD: 15.5" • Solaire: 13" • Memory Foam Hybrid: 11.5" • Rx: 15" If you place your mattress on a foundation, Saatva foundations are available in standard height (8.75") and low profile (4.75"). You can mix and match the thickness of a mattress and foundation to get the overall bed height that works best for you. Read our blog to learn more about finding the perfect mattress height for you. What are the weights of the mattresses? Expand/Collapse Saatva Classic: Twin: 11.5'' = 90 lbs. 14.5'' = 100 lbs. Twin XL: 11.5'' = 95 lbs. 14.5'' = 105 lbs. Full: 11.5'' = 100 lbs. 14.5'' = 110 lbs. Queen: 11.5'' = 110 lbs. 14.5'' = 120 lbs. King/Cal King: 11.5'' = 130 lbs. 14.5'' = 145 lbs. Split King (two Twin XLs): 11.5'' = 95 lbs. each 14.5'' = 105 lbs. each Contour5: Twin: 55 lbs. Twin XL: 59 lbs. Full: 77 lbs. Queen: 92 lbs. King/Cal King: 116 lbs. Split King: 118 lbs./59 lbs. each Zenhaven: Twin: 80 lbs. Twin XL: 82 lbs. Full: 100 lbs. Queen: 125 lbs. King/King Upper-Flex/Cal King: 165 lbs. Split King: 164 lbs./82 lbs. each Solaire: Twin XL: 85 lbs. Full: 106 lbs. Queen/Queen Upper-Flex: 114 lbs. King/King Upper-Flex/Cal King: 135 lbs.

Twin XL: 85 lbs. Full: 115 lbs. Queen: 120 lbs. King: 150 lbs. Cal King: 148 lbs. Split King: 170 lbs./85 lbs. each Memory Foam Hybrid: Twin: 43 lbs. Twin XL: 46 lbs. Full: 57 lbs. Queen: 70 lbs. King/Cal King: 86 lbs. Split King: 92 lbs./46 lbs. each Saatva Rx: Twin: 70 lbs. Twin XL: 76 lbs. Full: 99 lbs. Queen: 124 lbs. King/Cal King: 151 lbs. Split King: 152 lbs./76 lbs. each Saatva Youth: Twin: 45 lbs. Twin XL: 56 lbs. Full: 61 lbs. Saatva Crib mattress: 18 lbs./20 lbs. boxed Saatva Bunk & Trundle mattress: Twin: 34 lbs. Twin XL: 36 lbs. Full: 49 lbs. Dog Bed: Small: 7 lbs. Medium: 13 lbs. Large: 22.5 lbs. Will my Saatva mattress work with my existing box spring or foundation? Expand/Collapse You can use your existing box spring or foundation if: • You purchased your box spring or foundation within the last seven years • Your existing box spring or foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support NOTE: Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD Foundation for adequate support. Saatva mattresses also work with platform beds, without the need for a foundation or box spring. Please make sure your existing platform bed has the following: • A solid, durable surface. If your platform has a slatted support system, make sure the slats are spaced less than 4" apart. If they're not, you can add a 1/2" thick piece of plywood or a bunkie board over the slats for optimal support. This extra layer of support is needed because Saatva mattresses are heavier due to their premium quality materials • A proper center support. This means you must have a center leg in the middle of your platform bed frame NOTE: When used with our dual-sided Zenhaven mattress, you must add a solid surface over platform slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board. If you have any questions, you can reach one of our sleep guides 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882. What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with? Expand/Collapse Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames. Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a bunkie board. Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that we strongly suggest pairing the Saatva HD with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support. Can I use an adjustable base with any mattress? Expand/Collapse Adjustable bases work with mattresses that are designed to flex without shifting the inner materials or weakening the structure. Saatva adjustable bases are compatible with the following Saatva mattresses: • Saatva Classic Luxury Hybrid Innerspring (11.5-inch height only) • Contour5 Cooling Memory Foam • Memory Foam Hybrid •Saatva Latex Hybrid •Zenhaven Latex •Solaire Adjustable •Saatva Rx If you'd like to pair your adjustable bed base with a non-Saatva mattress, contact the manufacturer to check if it's compatible with an adjustable base. Are Saatva mattresses compatible with murphy beds? Expand/Collapse The following Saatva mattresses are compatible with Murphy beds: 11.5'' height Saatva Classic Contour5 Memory Foam Hybrid Bunk & Trundle Mattress Saatva Latex Hybrid These mattresses work with Murphy beds, provided the bed frame is compatible with the height/thickness of the mattress. It's very important to check with the manufacturer of your Murphy bed frame to see the maximum allowed mattress height/thickness and weight capacity  before purchasing a mattress for it. What is a Split King mattress? Expand/Collapse A Split King mattress has the exact same dimensions as a king mattress, but made up of two separate Twin XL mattresses. This is a great option for those who have narrow entryways and staircases. Split King is also a great option for couples who want a king size mattress, but have different firmness preferences. Simply order two separate Twin XL mattresses in different comfort/firmness options. If ordering two different mattress styles, be mindful of the mattress heights for each mattress. Lastly, Split King mattresses are great paired with a Split King adjustable base so that each sleeper can control the head and foot incline/decline on their side independently from their partner. To order a Split King consisting of two different mattress types, add the two Twin XLs you want to your cart separately rather than selecting Split King size. If you need any assistance placing the order, give our sleep guides a call at 877-672-2882. What is CertiPUR-US®? Expand/Collapse Foams in the bedding or upholstered furniture that are CertiPUR-US® certified have been tested to meet their rigorous standards for emissions, content and durability. Specifically, the foam is: Made without formaldehyde Made without ozone depleters Made without phthalates regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Made without mercury, lead and other heavy metals Low VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million) Screened for relevant chemicals, including flame retardants, that are classified as carcinogens, mutagens or reproductive toxins and are harmful to human health *CertiPUR-US® is a registered trademark of the Alliance for Flexible Polyurethane Foam, Inc. What is GREENGUARD Gold certified? Expand/Collapse The UL GREENGUARD Gold* Certification Standard includes health-based criteria for additional chemicals and requires lower total VOC (volatile organic compounds) emissions levels to ensure that products are acceptable for use in environments such as schools and healthcare facilities. In addition to limiting emissions of more than 360 VOCs and total chemical emissions, UL GREENGUARD Gold Certified products must also comply with the requirements of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Standard Method for the Testing and Evaluation of Volatile Organic Chemical Emissions from Indoor Sources Using Environmental Chambers, also known as California Section 01350. All certified products are subject to a review of the manufacturing process and routine testing to demonstrate minimal impact on the indoor environment in the long period. By purchasing products that carry this certification, you’re helping reduce indoor air pollution and your family’s risk of daily chemical exposure to potentially harmful substances. *GREENGUARD Gold is a trademark of UL LLC What's in your exclusive Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment? Expand/Collapse Our exclusive antimicrobial treatment by Guardin™ is made with a proprietary blend of essential oils and minerals. This blend includes thyme, geranium, lemongrass, and mint, but is completely odorless and colorless. Added to Saatva’s mattress ticking during the manufacturing process and engineered to last the life of the mattress, Guardin™ inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, mildew, and the discoloration that they can cause on the surface of a mattress. Unlike other mattress brands that use antimicrobial treatments made from heavy metals, Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment is biodegradable and does not contain any fluorocarbons, toxic heavy metals, silver nanotechnology, triclosan, formaldehyde or phthalates. What are the benefits of the Extend™ protection plan? Expand/Collapse The Extend™ protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage. This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva mattress warranty, such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse. Plans are effective from the day your mattress is delivered. For more info about Extend™ accident protection, check out our Extend™ page. Can I try your mattresses in person? Expand/Collapse Yes! Our Saatva Viewing Rooms are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life. What is on display to order at Saatva stores? Expand/Collapse All merchandise, including mattresses, select bed frames, and bedding products are on display to order in our Saatva Viewing Rooms across the country . Everything we have on display includes free white glove delivery or free ground shipping (for smaller goods like bedding). Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code. Pillows, bedding products, and rugs come with a 45-day free return policy. Mattress toppers come with a 180-night home trial. Mattresses and bedroom furniture come with our 365-night home trial*. If you decide to return your mattress or furniture within that home trial period, we will issue you a refund of your purchase price. The only cost to you is a $99 processing fee. * Excludes adjustable bases which are not eligible for returns or exchanges. What is white glove delivery? Expand/Collapse White glove delivery is the Saatva service standard and comes free with every mattress, bedroom furniture, and rug order. While our teams don't actually wear white gloves, we do all the work for you. We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge! Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code. Our bedroom furniture is also hand-delivered and assembled (if applicable) and bedroom rugs are delivered and set up in the room of your choice (rug area must be cleared of furniture by customer prior to delivery). You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service. *Note that our delivery teams won't take away the following items: • Waterbed bases • Standard metal bed frames • Sleep Number bases • Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs What if I need to return or exchange my mattress? Expand/Collapse If you aren't completely happy with your Saatva mattress or you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at 1-877-672-2882. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and issue a refund for the purchase price (taxes included) to your original method of payment if you are returning or start the exchange process. You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee and we’ll take care of the rest! Note that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7. We never resell returned mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them at cost to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery partners. Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress? Expand/Collapse Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage. Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882. What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it? Expand/Collapse All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month. Remember that your body will need some time to adjust to a brand new mattress. If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress. If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at 1-877-672-2882 and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you. Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more? Expand/Collapse We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount. Note that your cart will automatically apply the larger discount if there is a promotional sale on Saatva.com that is better than your ID.me discount. We also occasionally offer promotional sales for limited time periods on our products on Saatva.com and Saatva Viewing Rooms. To be one of the first to learn about our latest sales, sign up for our mailing list at our site footer or text BED to SAATVA (722882). You can unsubscribe at any time. Are your phone and store representatives on commission? Expand/Collapse No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way. What are the advantages of mattresses that are crafted in America? Expand/Collapse Mattresses crafted in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections. Knowing where your mattress is crafted makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattress manufacturers (like our network of 14 domestic factories) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products. Why am I being charged a mattress recycling fee? Expand/Collapse Laws in California, Connecticut, and Rhode Island require us to collect a small fee at checkout for every mattress, foundation, and adjustable base sold. The fees are used to fund recycling efforts in these states, as part of a program called Bye Bye Mattress. This program is operated by the Mattress Recycling Council, a nonprofit organization started by the mattress industry. The fees go toward the collection and processing of discarded mattresses and foundations. Per state laws, we have to collect the fee even if you don't plan on getting rid of your old mattress right now. Mattresses don't last forever—eventually, you'll have to discard your old one, and the fees will help cover the recycling costs when the time comes. About 20 million mattresses end up in U.S. landfills every year—that's about 55,000 per day—and that can take a toll on the environment. Since 2015, Bye Bye Mattress has helped reduce the number of mattresses that end up in landfills by recycling six million mattresses. Recycling a mattress has many benefits: It conserves resources, with recyclable materials such as foam padding, steel springs, and wooden frames being used to make new products; it creates recycling jobs; it reduces the number of illegally dumped mattresses; and it results in less reliance on landfills. + Don't just take our word for it 97.5% of customers surveyed said they would recommend Saatva to their friends and family* 91% of customers surveyed said they wake up more refreshed after sleeping on their Saatva than on their previous mattress* 95% of customers surveyed said that they are sleeping better on their Saatva than on their previous mattress* 93.1% of customers surveyed said that Saatva helped alleviate their NECK pain* 93.9% of customers surveyed said that Saatva helped alleviate their BACK pain* + Saatva has earned an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and 96% of Saatva customers are satisfied with their purchase**.

Customer Reviews Expand/Collapse Customer reviews Find the right bed setup for you Comfort starts from the ground up. The right bed base not only upgrades your sleep comfort, it can increase the lifespan of your mattress. Let's break down all of the options: Platform Bed Frame Standard Bed Frame + Foundation Foundation Adjustable Base This setup is great for: A sleek, low-profile look Those who prefer not to use a foundation or box spring Compatible with: Most mattresses NOTE: Must add a solid surface over the slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board, when used with the dual-sided Zenhaven Natural Latex Mattress. Shop platform bed frames Foundation vs. box spring: What’s the difference? A mattress foundation is a new & improved version of the old-fashioned box spring. Foundations use more stable wood support slats, while box springs use bouncier metal coils for support. This setup is great for: Making your bed the focal point of your bedroom Giving added height to your mattress Mattresses that require solid surface support (no slats), like our Zenhaven Latex Mattress & Saatva HD Compatible with: All mattresses (Our Saatva HD requires the HD foundation for optimal support) Shop mattress foundation Shop standard bed frames Foundation vs. box spring: What’s the difference?

That’s it. + What is a hybrid foam mattress? Expand/Collapse Memory Foam Hybrid is a hybrid foam mattress that combines the deep, body-contouring support of memory foam with the responsive support and "springy" feel of an innerspring mattress. They're great for just about all types of sleepers, whether you're a back sleeper, side sleeper, or a combination of both. What is memory foam made of? Expand/Collapse Memory foam, also known as viscoelastic foam, is a type of high-density polyurethane foam. Its distinguishing feature is that it softens in response to heat and pressure. That’s what gives memory foam mattresses their body-hugging, body-contouring feel. How long do memory foam mattresses last? Expand/Collapse The durability of a foam mattress can vary greatly depending on the quality and density of the foams. A premium, high-quality memory foam mattress should last you anywhere from 10 to 15 years. Are memory foam mattresses hot? Expand/Collapse Traditional foam mattresses have a tendency to trap body heat, but new technologies like gel-infused memory foams have come a long way in helping you sleep cooler. Saatva memory foam mattresses also feature covers made naturally breathable organic cotton. If you tend to sleep hot, placing your memory foam mattress on a box spring or a platform with open slats will help increase overall airflow. It’s also a great idea to top off your mattress with breathable sheets made from natural fabrics to create a cooler, more comfortable sleep environment all around. Are memory foam mattresses good for my back? Expand/Collapse Yes. Memory foam mattresses conform to your body, helping to keep your spine in a healthy, neutral alignment in any sleep position. Consider your preferred sleeping position when shopping for a foam mattress. If you’re a side sleeper, a softer foam mattress may help reduce pressure on your shoulders and hips. If you sleep on your back or stomach, a medium-firm comfort level or firmer will prevent your hips from sinking too deeply into the mattress. Are memory foam mattresses safe? Expand/Collapse We only use nontoxic CertiPUR-US® certified foams in our mattresses. This means that the foams are made without CFCs and other ozone depleters. They also don’t use PBDEs, TDCPP, or TCEP ("Tris"), which are flame retardants that have been identified by the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) as substances that may cause cancer, genetic defects, or damage fertility. CertiPUR-US® compliant foams are free of phthalates, formaldehyde, and mercury, lead, or other heavy metals. They're also tested to verify low VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions, so your mattress won’t off-gas in your home. Do Saatva mattresses contain fiberglass or a fiberglass sock? Expand/Collapse No. We never use fiberglass or toxic chemical flame retardants/barriers in any of our mattresses. Instead, we use either plant-based flame barriers, a Paladin flame barrier made with a blend of poly & rayon fibers, or organic New Zealand wool in our mattresses to meet federal safety standards. What flame retardants do Saatva mattresses use? Expand/Collapse The following Saatva mattresses use a natural, plant-based thistle flame retardant made of wood pulp bonded with a small amount of polyester: • Saatva Classic • Saatva HD • Saatva Youth • Memory Foam Hybrid (also contains natural wool as a flame retardant) The following Saatva mattresses use 100% GOTS certified organic New Zealand wool as a natural flame retardant: • Zenhaven Latex • Saatva Latex Hybrid • Crib Mattress Solaire adjustable firmness mattress uses Paladin, which is composed of flame retardant rayon fibers blended with polyester fibers. Contour5 memory foam mattress is covered on all six sides with a GREENGUARD®* Gold Certified natural flame barrier made of nontoxic cellulose fibers derived from tree byproducts. Bunk & Trundle mattress uses a nontoxic natural thistle & wool blend flame barrier. We do not use any harmful chemicals or sprays in any of our mattresses. What is off gassing? Expand/Collapse Off gassing is the term for what happens when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) leak out of upholstery materials and mattress foams and into the air you breathe. Some people refer to this as a "new mattress smell" that can range from unpleasant to downright nauseating. Learn more on our blog about off gassing and how Saatva mattresses cut down or completely eliminate this common issue. Do I need to flip over or rotate my mattress regularly? Expand/Collapse Our Zenhaven, Latex Hybrid, Saatva HD, and Solaire mattresses do not need to be rotated from head to foot. This is due to the 5-zone alignment of the latex layer in those mattresses. Our other mattresses can be rotated. We recommend rotating the mattress after six months and then once a year after that. This will ensure that the surface of the mattress breaks in evenly. How do I clean my mattress? Expand/Collapse As part of regular maintenance, vacuum your mattress at least twice a year to get rid of dust, crumbs, and other icky things that might be living in there. You can also deodorize your mattress by generously sprinkling it with baking soda. Leave it on for a full day and then vacuum it up to refresh your mattress. Tip: Adding a mattress pad over your mattress gives it an added layer of protection from stains, moisture, and debris. Just make sure to wash your mattress pad regularly. For more mattress care tips, check out this blog . What is the best mattress for back pain? Expand/Collapse Picking the right mattress to help ease back pain starts with assessing your typical sleep position, then choosing a mattress firmness that best supports you in that position. Saatva mattresses are the only ones with patented Lumbar Zone® Technology. That means every Saatva mattress is designed with dedicated lumbar support at the center third of the mattress where you need it most. Benefits of this lumbar zone support include better spinal alignment, circulation, and pressure relief. Is Saatva a bed in a box? Expand/Collapse No. Bed in a box (BIAB) mattresses are compressed, shrink-wrapped, folded, then rolled into a cardboard box for shipping. While this allows BIAB companies to save on freight costs, it takes a severe toll on the integrity of the foam mattress by breaking down the cell structure of the foams. It can also result in uneven firmness and sinking support in some areas, reducing the overall lifespan of the mattress. We believe your bed deserves better than being stuffed in a box. That’s why all Saatva mattresses come with FREE white glove delivery and in-home set up. We even take away your old mattress for free! How do I choose the right mattress height? Expand/Collapse Personal and aesthetic preferences are among the factors to consider when choosing the ideal mattress height/thickness. As a rule, mattress thickness alone is not an indicator of quality; that's more a function of mattress material and construction. A thicker mattress might be right for you if: • You have a larger body or are taller • You want to get on and off your bed with ease • Your bed frame or headboard requires a thicker/taller mattress A thinner mattress might be right for you if: • You don’t want to deal with a heavier mattress • You're shorter and don’t want to climb up into bed • You don’t want to purchase deep pocket or extra-deep pocket sheets Below are the heights (or thicknesses) of our Saatva mattresses: • Saatva Classic: 11.5" or 14.5" • Contour5: 12.5" • Latex Hybrid: 12" • Zenhaven: 10" • Saatva HD: 15.5" • Solaire: 13" • Memory Foam Hybrid: 11.5" • Rx: 15" If you place your mattress on a foundation, Saatva foundations are available in standard height (8.75") and low profile (4.75"). You can mix and match the thickness of a mattress and foundation to get the overall bed height that works best for you. Read our blog to learn more about finding the perfect mattress height for you. Do hybrid mattresses need a box spring or foundation? Expand/Collapse You don’t need a box spring or foundation if you have a platform bed. Otherwise, if your existing foundation or bed support system is over 7 years old or is sagging or damaged in any way, we suggest getting a high-quality Saatva foundation to get the most out of your new mattress. Your mattress warranty remains in place even when you use your own existing foundation or box spring. What bed frames are Saatva mattresses compatible with? Expand/Collapse Saatva mattresses are compatible with any bed frame, including our Saatva bed frames. Our dual-sided Zenhaven latex mattresses cannot be placed directly on a platform bed frame with slats. You must cover the slats with a solid material, such as plywood or a bunkie board. Non-platform (standard) bed frames require a foundation and can be paired with any mattress. Note that we strongly suggest pairing the Saatva HD with the HD foundation, which is specifically designed to give it optimal support. Can I use an adjustable base with any mattress? Expand/Collapse Adjustable bases work with mattresses that are designed to flex without shifting the inner materials or weakening the structure. Saatva adjustable bases are compatible with the following Saatva mattresses: • Saatva Classic Luxury Hybrid Innerspring (11.5-inch height only) • Contour5 Cooling Memory Foam • Memory Foam Hybrid •Saatva Latex Hybrid •Zenhaven Latex •Solaire Adjustable •Saatva Rx If you'd like to pair your adjustable bed base with a non-Saatva mattress, contact the manufacturer to check if it's compatible with an adjustable base. Are Saatva mattresses compatible with murphy beds? Expand/Collapse The following Saatva mattresses are compatible with Murphy beds: 11.5'' height Saatva Classic Contour5 Memory Foam Hybrid Bunk & Trundle Mattress Saatva Latex Hybrid These mattresses work with Murphy beds, provided the bed frame is compatible with the height/thickness of the mattress. It's very important to check with the manufacturer of your Murphy bed frame to see the maximum allowed mattress height/thickness and weight capacity  before purchasing a mattress for it. Will my Saatva mattress work with my existing box spring or foundation? Expand/Collapse You can use your existing box spring or foundation if: • You purchased your box spring or foundation within the last seven years • Your existing box spring or foundation is in good condition and provides sturdy center support NOTE: Saatva HD requires pairing with the HD Foundation for adequate support. Saatva mattresses also work with platform beds, without the need for a foundation or box spring. Please make sure your existing platform bed has the following: • A solid, durable surface. If your platform has a slatted support system, make sure the slats are spaced less than 4" apart. If they're not, you can add a 1/2" thick piece of plywood or a bunkie board over the slats for optimal support. This extra layer of support is needed because Saatva mattresses are heavier due to their premium quality materials • A proper center support. This means you must have a center leg in the middle of your platform bed frame NOTE: When used with our dual-sided Zenhaven mattress, you must add a solid surface over platform slats such as plywood, masonite board, or bunkie board. If you have any questions, you can reach one of our sleep guides 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882. What is CertiPUR-US®? Expand/Collapse Foams in the bedding or upholstered furniture that are CertiPUR-US® certified have been tested to meet their rigorous standards for emissions, content and durability. Specifically, the foam is: Made without formaldehyde Made without ozone depleters Made without phthalates regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Made without mercury, lead and other heavy metals Low VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions for indoor air quality (less than 0.5 parts per million) Screened for relevant chemicals, including flame retardants, that are classified as carcinogens, mutagens or reproductive toxins and are harmful to human health *CertiPUR-US® is a registered trademark of the Alliance for Flexible Polyurethane Foam, Inc.

Expand/Collapse Our exclusive antimicrobial treatment by Guardin™ is made with a proprietary blend of essential oils and minerals. This blend includes thyme, geranium, lemongrass, and mint, but is completely odorless and colorless. Added to Saatva’s mattress ticking during the manufacturing process and engineered to last the life of the mattress, Guardin™ inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, mildew, and the discoloration that they can cause on the surface of a mattress. Unlike other mattress brands that use antimicrobial treatments made from heavy metals, Guardin™ antimicrobial treatment is biodegradable and does not contain any fluorocarbons, toxic heavy metals, silver nanotechnology, triclosan, formaldehyde or phthalates. What are the benefits of the Extend™ protection plan? Expand/Collapse The Extend™ protection plan provides peace of mind and financial protection for your mattress investment from accidental damage. This plan covers accidental stains and damage NOT covered by the Saatva mattress warranty, such as rips, tears and stains. This plan does not cover theft or damage caused by abuse or misuse. Plans are effective from the day your mattress is delivered. For more info about Extend™ accident protection, check out our Extend™ page. Can I try your mattresses in person? Expand/Collapse Yes! Our Saatva Viewing Rooms are inviting, pressure-free spaces to experience Saatva comfort in real life. What is on display to order at Saatva stores? Expand/Collapse All merchandise, including mattresses, select bed frames, and bedding products are on display to order in our Saatva Viewing Rooms across the country . Everything we have on display includes free white glove delivery or free ground shipping (for smaller goods like bedding). Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code. Pillows, bedding products, and rugs come with a 45-day free return policy. Mattress toppers come with a 180-night home trial. Mattresses and bedroom furniture come with our 365-night home trial*. If you decide to return your mattress or furniture within that home trial period, we will issue you a refund of your purchase price. The only cost to you is a $99 processing fee. * Excludes adjustable bases which are not eligible for returns or exchanges. What is white glove delivery? Expand/Collapse White glove delivery is the Saatva service standard and comes free with every mattress, bedroom furniture, and rug order. While our teams don't actually wear white gloves, we do all the work for you. We hand-deliver your mattress and set it up in the room of your choice. We also take away your old mattress and foundation* if you select the "free mattress & foundation removal" at checkout—all at no extra charge! Typically, mattress orders are delivered from our factories within a 9-21 day time frame, depending on your zip code. Our bedroom furniture is also hand-delivered and assembled (if applicable) and bedroom rugs are delivered and set up in the room of your choice (rug area must be cleared of furniture by customer prior to delivery). You get all this for free as part of our premium white glove delivery service. *Note that our delivery teams won't take away the following items: • Waterbed bases • Standard metal bed frames • Sleep Number bases • Stained and/or damaged mattresses & foundations/box springs What if I need to return or exchange my mattress? Expand/Collapse If you aren't completely happy with your Saatva mattress or you decide to exchange your mattress for another Saatva mattress during your 365-night home trial, just give us a call at 1-877-672-2882. We’ll schedule a pick up of your mattress and issue a refund for the purchase price (taxes included) to your original method of payment if you are returning or start the exchange process. You’ll only pay a $99 processing fee and we’ll take care of the rest! Note that the most common reason people exchange is for a different mattress size or height, so be sure to measure the height of your bed frame, adjustable base, and/or foundation/box spring before ordering. You can also call one of our friendly sleep guides for assistance 24/7. We never resell returned mattresses. Instead, we donate them to veterans' shelters or offer them at cost to employees and associates across our network of more than 150 delivery partners. Can I expedite the delivery of my mattress? Expand/Collapse Every Saatva mattress is made to order, which means they don't sit in storage. Occasionally, we can shorten the delivery time when we have a change or cancellation from another order of the exact same product. This allows us to redirect that freshly made and sealed mattress to you. We’d love to help in any way if you need your mattress faster. Our friendly sleep guides are here for you 24/7 at 1-877-672-2882. What do I do if I think my mattress feels too firm when I receive it? Expand/Collapse All of our mattresses are made to order and arrive to you factory fresh. That means the high-quality materials inside them need a little bit of time to soften up. You should notice your new mattress begin to conform to your body after a few days. You may even notice continuing improvement for up to a month. Remember that your body will need some time to adjust to a brand new mattress. If you've been sleeping on an old mattress, your body likely got used to it, even if it didn't provide you with adequate support. That's why we give you a generous 365-night home trial to give you time to acclimate to your new mattress. If after a month or so, you still feel that your mattress is too firm (or too soft), give us a call at 1-877-672-2882 and one of our friendly sleep guides will be happy to help you. Does Saatva offer any discounts to first responders, veterans, active military & more? Expand/Collapse We offer a year-round $225 discount off orders of $1,000 or more to active military, veterans, first responders, government employees, nurses, teachers, senior citizens & students. To apply the discount, simply click on the "Discount for first responders & more" box at checkout. You will be prompted to register with ID.me to verify your status and receive the discount. Note that your cart will automatically apply the larger discount if there is a promotional sale on Saatva.com that is better than your ID.me discount. We also occasionally offer promotional sales for limited time periods on our products on Saatva.com and Saatva Viewing Rooms. To be one of the first to learn about our latest sales, sign up for our mailing list at our site footer or text BED to SAATVA (722882). You can unsubscribe at any time. Are your phone and store representatives on commission? Expand/Collapse No. It’s part of our pledge to be honest and transparent about what you’re buying. Saatva is committed to giving you honest guidance, even if it means directing you to another mattress brand that’s a better fit for you. In a regular mattress store environment, a commissioned employee makes more money when they sell you a particular brand, so you may get pressured into a choice that’s not right for you. That’s just not the Saatva way. What are the advantages of mattresses that are crafted in America? Expand/Collapse Mattresses crafted in the U.S.A. must meet strict health, safety, and environmental standards. The U.S. and the E.U. have the toughest regulations, but other countries may not offer the same protections. Knowing where your mattress is crafted makes it easier to ensure that the manufacturer adheres to guidelines that protect workers from danger and exploitation, such as labor regulations and minimum-wage laws. Reputable mattress manufacturers (like our network of 14 domestic factories) also work to minimize environmental impact by incorporating low-carbon-footprint processes and recycled materials into their products. Why am I being charged a mattress recycling fee? Expand/Collapse Laws in California, Connecticut, and Rhode Island require us to collect a small fee at checkout for every mattress, foundation, and adjustable base sold. The fees are used to fund recycling efforts in these states, as part of a program called Bye Bye Mattress. This program is operated by the Mattress Recycling Council, a nonprofit organization started by the mattress industry. The fees go toward the collection and processing of discarded mattresses and foundations. Per state laws, we have to collect the fee even if you don't plan on getting rid of your old mattress right now. Mattresses don't last forever—eventually, you'll have to discard your old one, and the fees will help cover the recycling costs when the time comes. About 20 million mattresses end up in U.S. landfills every year—that's about 55,000 per day—and that can take a toll on the environment. Since 2015, Bye Bye Mattress has helped reduce the number of mattresses that end up in landfills by recycling six million mattresses. Recycling a mattress has many benefits: It conserves resources, with recyclable materials such as foam padding, steel springs, and wooden frames being used to make new products; it creates recycling jobs; it reduces the number of illegally dumped mattresses; and it results in less reliance on landfills. + Don't just take our word for it 97.5% of customers surveyed said they would recommend Saatva to their friends and family* 91% of customers surveyed said they wake up more refreshed after sleeping on their Saatva than on their previous mattress* 95% of customers surveyed said that they are sleeping better on their Saatva than on their previous mattress* 93.1% of customers surveyed said that Saatva helped alleviate their NECK pain* 93.9% of customers surveyed said that Saatva helped alleviate their BACK pain* + Saatva has earned an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and 96% of Saatva customers are satisfied with their purchase**. See for yourself why we have the highest customer review ratings in the mattress industry. *From a recent Saatva customer satisfaction survey, which we conduct on a regular basis to ensure service, product, and overall quality standards. **Based off Saatva return rates.

By Claire Brito Published: Sep 30, 2022 6:18 PM EDT Save Article Design duo Chip and Joanna Gaines are taking on their biggest fixer yet: an over 100-year-old historic castle in Waco, Texas. Coming on Friday, October 14 to the Magnolia Network , Fixer Upper: Welcome Home - The Castle will feature six half-hour long episodes documenting the couple's total overhaul of a once-abandoned Central Texas estate. Dustin Cohen Known to Waco locals as Cottonland Castle, the stone structure dates back to 1913. "Chip and I have a long history of taking on unusual projects," Joanna writes in The Magnolia Journal , reminiscing on the first time her and her husband drove by the dilapidated structure in their hometown. "Yet, despite their various states of disrepair, to us these places tend to radiate a certain unexpected charm." Courtesy of Magnolia Network "The plan is to bring this beautiful property back to its original state," says Chip, who admits he'd been eying the purchase for two decades. But from efforts to preserve original elements like plaster and stonework to unexpected water leaks, the castle's overhaul turned out to be a much larger project than the couple anticipated. "Getting the same exact stone from 100 years ago has been a challenge," says Jo. Courtesy of Magnolia Network Tune in to see how the couple rose to the design challenge and unveil their biggest transformation yet. And, if you find yourself in the Waco area this fall, tickets are on sale for walking tours through the castle now through October 26 .

I’m always hesitant about buying seating furniture from Amazon because of all the variables. The chair was on sale and was soooo much cheaper than what I was seeing at Cb2, West Elm, Marshall’s, etc. So I thought I’d give it a try. 100% a smaller chair, which for me works because of my space. Someone mentioned it may not be a comfy fit for larger individuals, but as a 5’6-person, I feel like this chair was made for me lol. Anyway, comfy and the leather is beautiful. I’ll post an updated review if anything happens or a quality issue comes up :). Feels really sturdy as well. I’m a bit on the thicker side… I don’t feel like the chair is compromised because of this, so I’m very pleased with this purchase. The cushions are also padded quite well.

AmeriAussie 5.0 out of 5 stars Fabulous - I'd give it 10 stars if I could Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024 Style: Verity Lounge Chair Size: Single Color: Cognac Tan Verified Purchase I cannot rate this chair highly enough. It is beautiful. The leather is stunning - and it's full leather on the back piece on both sides so it can be flipped if needed. The wood is gorgeous too. This feels like a $1200 chair to me.  It's deep and solid so my 6' 4" 250 lbs nephew sits comfortably. It's sits a bit lower than your average aide chair but that's the style it's intended to be. And best part - it comes fully assembled in the most amazing  packaging. All you have to do is slide it out of the box. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.

Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024 Style: Verity Lounge Chair Size: Single Color: Distressed Green Velvet Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded. I’m so glad I purchased this. It’s everything the reviewers have said, well made solid. I bought the green distressed velvet. Color is exactly what I wanted! I don’t know how to describe it but it’s a great material very durable. I have cats with nails that are jumping off of it playing and so far no snags! And it’s  very comfortable! Plus it’s all one piece. I didn’t have to put any screws in. It doesn’t look cheap. I agree with other reviewers you’d pay twice this amount for one at say pottery barn. So glad I took a chance on it! Make sure to measure the depth though, it’s long but good for tall people. May stick out in a small space. Read more M. Young 5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful chair! Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024 I’m so glad I purchased this.

Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024 Style: Verity Lounge Chair Size: Single Color: Cognac Tan Verified Purchase I agonized quite a bit over the kind of chair that I would purchase to go with my leather sectional of a similar color. A lot of the styles that I found just didn't match my aesthetic, but once I found THIS one, I was in love. The leather is soft and the curvature of the armrests is perfect. The bottom cushion has straps to attach it to the frame. The top cushion is not attached, but it doesn't slide when you sit in it.  My husband is 6 feet tall and I am 5 feet tall and we both find it comfortable. I've spent more time in this chair in the first couple of weeks that I've owned it than I spent in my previous chair that I had owned for years. I highly recommend this chair.

Somehow I ended up ordering 2. Boy am I glad I did. The chairs are well made and sturdy. They came well package and no assembly needed.  Leather is top grain (real leather). Wood is real hardwood. For $600 these are a bargain. I looked at similar chairs at Pottery Barn and West Elm and those go for $1000-$1400. If you are on the fence about these just get them.

The leather is Incredible! It's soft and beautiful It has a gray undertone which gives it a nice texture. It’s comfortable and deep seated. To repeat from my first review.  it’s somewhat low to the ground and a smaller scale which is perfect for my tiny space. It gives a good balance to the room.  I love that it came put together and packaged very well.  I pulled it out of the box and set it up in my living room. This is probably one of my favorite purchases on Amazon.  Overall definitely five stars.

Easy to assemble. I bought a Queen size headboard and find the material of the headboard to be lovely. It came earlier than expected and everything in the box was well organized and labeled. The main legs are in the back of the headboard which you just lift the velcro strap cover and pull the legs out. The legs were shorter than I expected and would not feel as sturdy if I only used the top screw by itself to get maximum height so I used the top two holes and the height still worked out in the end. The bed I have with the foundation is generally taller and thicker than most regular beds so it worked out. The color I got was the gray but it was more of like a cream color which is what I was going for. I did not actually screw the headboard legs into my metal bed frame but the additional modifier tools provided would have worked but I was just too lazy to do it. Instead, I have the bed pushed against the headboard into the wall which just as well with no shaking at all. Overall, it is a solid product and I will likely buy another one for my guest bedroom.

I just put the headboard legs on the floor and pushed my bed up against it. It’s the right height and feels sturdy. I think it’s a great headboard for the price. Color looks good and texture feels nice.

Worth it. Read more Helpful Report Meg 5.0 out of 5 stars Just what I wanted! Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024 Size: Full Color: Gray Verified Purchase I've been looking for a headboard and had my eye on this one for a while! So when it finally restocked, I pounced lol. -Super easy installation (you can prob figure it out without instructions) -Elegant, modern look -Comes with extension plates in case your bedframe doesn't perfectly align with the headboard Probably the only negative thing about it is that it will be a pain to clean if it gets dirty.

Sarver 4.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024 Color: Coastal Oak Size: 58 Inch Verified Purchase Very easy assemble, although there is a lot of screws which may look scary at first, the manual shows the 20 steps and you can build it by yourself quickly, until you get to hanging the doors, which is a lot of easier with another person holding the door. It is smaller than I thought, I wanted it this low but I thought it was a bit wider, it looks nice and looks more expensive than it is but be careful removing the part stickers as it may peel the finish with it! Also make sure you put glue in the quarter turn inserts as they easily unscrew. Read more Helpful Report Maddi 5.0 out of 5 stars Looks great but the quality is questionable. Style 10/10 Build 8/10 wood quality 5/10 Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024 Color: Mocha Size: 58 Inch Verified Purchase I've been looking for a new TV stand for my bedroom but needed it to be an MCM style to match our apartment decor. I almost bought a black metal one then saw this under the recommended (never saw it before) but needed it. Overall, it is beautiful and looks super nice, The build time took me around 40 minutes alone, I worked at IKEA for 5 years, so this crap does not faze me but others yes...it's all in small parts and a million little screws and glue. Just go slow. I do have one major flaw with it and it's that the wood is SO FRAGILE, I was building it and noticed that the bottom part already had a scratch in the wood which can be seen in some of the photos. (You get what you pay for) I'm okay with this as...some colored pencils will do wonders. Overall I love it, the build time was fine and the style is immaculate. But note that this stand is SHORT. For reference, I've added a photo of my men's size 12 Converse. not much taller than the shoe. But my room is already MCM style so most of my furniture is low to the ground and from the bed it's perfect. 55-60inch TV on the smaller 40'' stand. Good luck!

Images in this review Helpful Report J Lisbon 1.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing Assembly and Return Experience Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024 Color: Mocha Size: 70 Inch Verified Purchase My experience was disappointing. Assembly is not easy and takes time, with so many screws to tighten that I ended up with blisters on my hands. After nearly an hour of work, I encountered a major issue at step 14: the pre-drilled holes for the base were only 1 mm deep, while the screws were 20 mm long. This manufacturing defect made it impossible to complete the assembly. While I could have drilled the holes myself, I didn't have a drill. When I called customer support, I was initially told I could dispose of the item and receive a refund. However, after noticing the refund hadn't been processed, I contacted them again and was informed that the product needed to be picked up instead. Since the instructions required gluing parts together, the unit cannot be disassembled for a normal return. The alternative pick-up process was quite bureaucratic, requiring me to fill out a lengthy form with over 10 fields of product information, such as weight, size, and order number—information that Amazon should already have. In total, I spent almost 6 hours dealing with this, and the pick-up was scheduled for 7 days later, leaving me with an unfinished and unusable piece of furniture taking up valuable space in my living room for a week. While other customers may have had better luck, this experience was frustrating for me. If you choose to buy this product, be aware that you may encounter significant challenges during assembly and potential complications if a return is needed.

"I could sit on 10 different brands's sheet sets and still tell you which ones are Boll & Branch. They're extremely soft and feel so luxurious. I will say: They're on the thicker side, so I don't really use them in the summer, even with air conditioning, because I definitely sleep hot. This is easily one of my favorite brands. Since buying them, I bought one more set of the pajamas, which are well worth it." Size Options: Twin, twin XL, f ull, queen, king, California king, and split king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Organic cotton Best Value Softest Sheets Mellanni Iconic Collection Sheet Set Now 37% Off $32 at Amazon $38 at Walmart Pros Available in more than 40 colors Temperature-regulating and moisture-wicking Less than $50 Cons Thick material The numbers don't lie: With more than 40 colors to choose from, a price tag under $40, and more than 350k reviews that, together, are just shy of a full five-star rating, these Amazon-favorite microfiber sheets are a steal we can rely on. It comes in a standard set that includes a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and two pillowcases, so you don't have to worry about buying anything à la carte. Because they're made of a thin microfiber, these sheets are both temperature-regulating and moisture-wicking, making them an ideal pick for summer. "These sheets pretty much got me through college," Cherner says. "I wanted something very basic and non-fancy that were still comfortable, and these were the winner for me. Back when I first bought them (more than a few years ago), there weren't quite as many reviews, but enough to make an educated purchase. They're not exactly cooling, but they aren't warming either, which I'll take." Contributing writer Kelsey Mulvey also tested Amazon's favorite sheets against the Costco option on this list and notes: "The microfiber material used here is lightweight, breathable, and temperature-regulating. While I didn't necessarily wake up feeling cold, I didn't start my mornings in a pool of sweat, either. The material felt silky smooth against my skin, similar to my favorite cooling bedding ." Size Options: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Microfiber cotton Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Softest Eucalyptus Sheets Threshold Cool TENCEL Lyocell Sheet Set Now 30% Off $52 at Target Pros Available in multiple colors Made of eucalyptus fiber Under $100 for a full set Cons May wrinkle when air-dried To summarize these sheets in one word, look at the product name: Cooling. Threshold doesn't do anything too wild (think patented technology) to make them cool; rather, it's the natural effect of TENCEL lyocell, a material made from eucalyptus pulp. Of course, they're also super soft, another element that comes with the material. This set also comes in seven colors, so if you want to stay chill in super-soft sheets, don't wait to add these to your cart. Snap them up before someone else beats you to it! Size Options: Twin/twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: TENCEL lyocell Softest Sateen Sheets Brooklinen Luxe Core Sheet Set Now 15% Off $161 at Brooklinen $179 at zola.com Pros No sagging, loose threads, or pilling Don't wrinkle after washing and drying Silky-smooth and cooling Cons Sold out in several colors "I have Brooklinen's luxe sateen sheets and am obsessed with them! They're silky to the touch without feeling too slippery, and I prefer them over linen sheets in summer since they're just as cooling without looking wrinkled all the time," Commerce Editor Samantha Jones says. "I've had them for a little over a year now and haven't noticed any pilling, loose threads, or snagging." So, if you want a low-maintenance sheet set that doesn't skimp on softness, this is a good get that's House Beautiful -approved. Plus, if it's your first time shopping for the brand, you can score 15 percent off by signing up for the weekly newsletter.

"Fast forward six months to when I move into my new apartment and I finally break these out. They're washed cotton percale, so they definitely have that crispness you wouldn't find in a bamboo or silk sheet, but that's why I love them. They feel more like a very, very smooth linen than cotton." Plus, these sheets come in a bevy of cool-toned neutrals, including a charming pin-striped pattern. Size Options: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, and king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Organic cotton percale Best Softest Sheets Deal Crate & Barrel Aire Sheet Set Now 59% Off $70 at Crate & Barrel Pros $100 off Lightweight and breathable Free shipping Cons Final sale cannot be returned or exchanged Yes, the Aire sheet set is a whopping $100 off for Crate & Barrel's annual summer sale. Why, you may wonder, are these sheets part of the summer sale? Well, they're cooling, which most tend to shop for during the warmer months, but as anyone who sleeps hot knows, night sweats don't end when PSL season arrives. So, these are a great find if you like to swaddle yourself in a set of thin, airy sheets with prime breathability. Because they're so discounted, most sizes and color options have been snatched up already, but there are two sizes and one color left. Hop to it! Size Options: Queen and king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Organic cotton Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Luxurious Softest Sheets Parachute Organic Soft Luxe Venice Set $579 at Parachute Home Pros Includes duvet cover Easy to clean Available with or without flat sheet Cons Available in only two colors "I tested this Parachute sheet set , including the matching duvet cover, when the collection launched back in August 2023, and it has quickly become my favorite thing to sleep on, which is saying a lot because I have slept on many a sheet," Cherner explains. "If I had to describe what they feel like using bedding terms, I'd say it's somewhere between sateen and jersey: They're thin and airy like sateen, but they're unbelievably soft and do have that T-shirt feel to them." The unique feel comes courtesy of the material, which is 100 percent organic cotton sateen that's brushed and garment washed, which gives it the jersey feel. The only difference? You won't wake up in a pool of sweat. "I know they're not exactly cheap, but after sleeping on these for a while, I can confirm they're worth every penny!" Size Options: Full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet (optional), two pillowcases, and duvet cover | Material: Organic cotton sateen Most Affordable Softest Sheets Quince Luxury Organic Sateen Sheet Set $99 at quince.com $90 at onequince.com Pros Available in 15 colors Comes in every size Flat sheet included Cons The material is not very stretchy "Quince is my go-to for luxury goods that I don't want to pay full price for," Cherner says. "My obsession with the brand started with its bevy of affordable cashmere and continued with the luggage, but my most recent purchase was the bedding. I spilled soy sauce (don't eat sushi in bed) on my white sheets and needed a replacement, so I went to Quince. These sheets are soft and cozy, but my favorite thing about them is how crisp they are. I opted for classic white, but this set comes in 15 colors, so if you want to go a bit bolder, you definitely can." Size Options: Twin, full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Organic cotton Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Lightweight Softest Sheets Sijo AiryWeight Eucalyptus Sheet Set Now 10% Off $85 at sijohome.com Pros Made from eco-friendly materials Comes in every size Affordable Cons Not ideal for winter "I'll be honest: I did not know this brand before a friend (who works in home design) sent me a set for my birthday last summer," Cherner admits. "I don't know what I was doing or where I was before I finally slept on these because they are a level of soft that I've never experienced. They're made of the brand's patented eucalyptus material called AiryWeight, which, as the name implies, is super light. I used these in the summer, so they were perfect. If you like to be snug and bundled in the colder months, though, you may want to swap these out for a set that's a bit thicker. These are so light you won't even feel them, which is why I really love them. The material also has cooling abilities, making them ideal for hot sleepers." Size Options: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet (optional), and two pillowcases | Material: TENCEL lyocell eucalyptus Softest Egyptian Sateen Sheets Hudson Park Collection Egyptian Sateen Fitted Sheets Now 20% Off $168 at Bloomingdale's Pros Made of 800 thread count sateen Crisp and smooth feel Available in multiple neutral colors Cons Sold à la carte Some sateen sheets feel like regular cotton, but these 800-thread count ones have a certain gloss that makes them both look and feel luxurious. The only downside is that you can't snag these in a set; you have to order each piece—the fitted sheet, flat sheet, and pillowcases—individually, which can get monotonous and expensive. The good news, however, is that these were designed to last, so once you order your set, you won't have to reorder for years to come. "My parents have these in all of their guest rooms, so every time I go home for the holidays or a long weekend, I get to sleep on them," Cherner says. "And I say 'get to' because lounging on these really is a luxurious experience. They feel like hotel sheets if the hotel in question is the most renowned in the world. My only complaint is that they're a bit warming, so if you sleep hot, these won't work for you. If you have the air conditioning on, they're well worth the price." Size Options: Queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Flat sheet | Material: Egyptian sateen Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Softest Bamboo Sheets Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set Now 20% Off $271 at Cozy Earth Pros Fits on both regular and deep pocket mattresses Machine washable Stain resistant Cons Some customers experienced pilling If you sweat when you sleep, no matter what time of year, you must get bamboo sheets. “Temperature-regulating and buttery soft, these sheets work for both my husband (a hot sleeper) and me (a cold one)," Senior Commerce Manager Mackenzie Dunn says. "I’ve tested a lot of sheets, and what sets these apart—in addition to the cloud-like feel—is their oversized fit. The flat sheet drapes beautifully over our queen-sized bed with plenty of room for two people to be cozy without ever fighting for coverage.” Size Options: T win, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, and split king | What's Included: Flat sheet, fitted sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Bamboo viscose Softest Cooling Linen Sheets Brooklinen Washed Linen Core Sheet Set Now 16% Off $269 at Brooklinen $229 at Amazon Pros Fitted sheets have "long” and "short” side tags Available in several limited-edition colors Cool to the touch Cons Taking a top spot in our tried-and-true best linen sheets roundup, this set, which includes a flat sheet, fitted sheet, and two pillowcases from fan-favorite brand Brooklinen, is light, cozy, and, best of all, super-soft because they're pre-washed. That means you don't have to worry about shrinkage. Plus, unlike cotton or silk, linen—a material ideal for hot sleepers—gets softer with each wash. "I have these sheets and have to admit that they are soft, but definitely not the softest on the list," Cherner says. "I think they're very soft for linen but not for cotton or eucalyptus if that makes sense. I do, however, love how cooling they are. When you flip the pillow over, it literally does feel cool to the touch, which I haven't experienced in any other brand." Size Options: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Washed linen Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Softest Moisture-Wicking Sheets Eucalypso Classic Sheet Set Now 30% Off $159 at eucalypsohome.com $198 at Nordstrom Rack $189 at Macy’s Pros Cooling to hot sleepers Made using natural fibers Available in multiple colors Cons Corner elastic band that holds the fitted sheet on is only available in a few colorways After sleeping on these cooling sheets for a week, House Beautiful contributor Kelsey Mulvey had some thoughts. First, they come in a set that includes a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, and two pillowcases. Second, they come in earthy shades that make your bedroom feel more like a spa-inspired sleep sanctuary. Most importantly, though, these sheets are made using premium TENCEL lyocell fibers, which come from eucalyptus wood pulp, hence the brand name. Mulvey says, "After my first night of sleeping on Eucalypso's TENCEL sheet set, I noticed that while I could feel the heat from the vent a few feet away from my toes, my body wasn't sweaty." Size Options: Twin, full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet and two pillowcases | Material: TENCEL lyocell Softest Egyptian Cotton Sheets Parachute Sateen Sheet Set $169 at Parachute Home Pros Finished in matte colors Carbon neutral shipping Smooth and crisp Cons Does not include flat sheet For anyone willing to make an investment in their sheets, Parachute's sateen set should be at the top of your list. Even though it's also made from 100 percent long-staple Egyptian cotton, it feels like silk, which, if you sleep cold, is a good thing. The material is finished in such a way that it actually seals the weave pattern, which makes the sheets feel a bit thicker, kind of like hotel sheets. Since not everyone sleeps with a top sheet, you can opt out of that layer and save a few bucks, too. "I got these when I first moved to New York almost seven years ago, and I have not noticed a difference in the quality after hundreds of washes," Cherner says. "My only issue with them is the color fading. I got them in a now-discontinued lavender shade, and they faded quite a bit in the sun. Now, they look like a gently tinged white, which I'm okay with. As for the softness, they're like a crisp, smooth hotel set. They're not noticeably soft, but they do feel super luxurious." Size Options: Full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet and two pillowcases | Material: Sateen Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Sustainable Softest Sheets Buffy Breeze Sheet Set Now 15% Off $166 at Buffy $199 at Huckberry Pros Fully biodegradable and compostable Utilizes plant-based dyes Good for hot weather Cons Takes a long time to dry Available in four sizes, this crisp set of eucalyptus sheets is easily one of our favorites because they are noticeably cooling. The set, which comprises a fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases, is also about as eco-friendly as bedding can get: The pieces are made from TENCEL lyocell (eucalyptus) and dyed with OEKO TEX-certified botanic dyes. Plus, they're fully biodegradable and compostable, not that you'll want to throw them out. "These are my summer sheets," Cherner says. (Yes, House Beautiful editors invest in sheets for every season.) "You won't notice that they're cooling if you touch the pillowcase for a few seconds, but after actually sleeping in the bed, you will absolutely realize that, even if you haven't moved in hours, the sheets feel chilled under your body, which is pretty impressive. For that reason, I can only really use them in the summer." Size Options: Full, queen, king, and California king | What's Included: Fitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases | Material: Eucalyptus How We Selected the Softest Sheets When it came to determining the softest sheets on the market, we, of course, had to test them to decide whether or not they were genuinely soft. Several of my fellow House Beautiful editors and I tested the aforementioned sheets in our homes for at least five days to give us enough time to review them properly. Some of us, however, have had our beloved sheets on our beds for more than a year, so you know they're good. It's also a real testament to their durability and longevity. For any sheets that did not pass through our hands directly, we sourced from brands we trust and read through all the reviews to ensure the sheets held up to our standards regarding durability and style. Like we say in the introduction, what is "soft" to us may not feel the same for you, so if you want to get a real sense of softness, read the material, which will give you an idea of the feel. With that in mind, we do break down all the important elements, from material to weight and breathability, so that you can make an informed decision on which sheets sound the softest and coziest for your own sleeping habits. We also did not hold back on pointing out some pros and cons to each set for shoppers to consider, as this is the most realistic way to purchase products. It's up to you if the pros outweigh the cons for you and vice versa. Luckily, we just so happened to love all of the sheets we tested and plan on keeping them in our rotation for, well, as long as they'll last.

To put it simply, the best thread count for soft sheets falls anywhere between 800 and 1,000 if you like your sheets silky. That said, high thread counts do come with some drawbacks. According to Brooklinen, thread counts tend to max out at 800—and when you see larger numbers than that, it's often because of a factor called ply (refers to the number of threads). Single-ply means it's comprised of single strands of thread. Still, according to Consumer Reports, manufacturers will often weave multiple strands together to create one thread, then beef up the thread count number as a result, which doesn't give you a better sheet. Single-ply sheets are softer and more durable, according to Brooklinen—and Consumer Reports notes that 400 is the best thread count to look for if you're factoring it in. While thread count does matter, other factors may play just as big of a role in determining softness and durability. And at the end of the day, the material or fiber will likely be the determining factor. Weave also impacts how your sheets will feel. Two main weaves you'll come across when shopping for sheets are sateen and percale, so knowing the difference is key. Sateen sheets have a silkier, softer finish but are often more expensive. And, just like your favorite sweater, they're also prone to pilling, according to Purple . A percale weave may be better if you're a hot sleeper. Purple also points out that percale will soften over time, and the weave of that fabric is typically more lightweight, giving you that cool feeling. What Types of Sheets Are the Softest Cotton: When it comes to cotton sheets, Egyptian cotton is considered the crème de la crème. While that may be true, Purple points out that true Egyptian cotton can be expensive and hard to find, and there are other types (take Pima, for example) that can be just as durable and soft. Overall, Purple suggests that your best bet is luxurious long-staple cotton. Linen: Linen sheets made from the flax plant tend to get softer over time. Linen dries faster than cotton and is also a sustainable fabric that's ideal for those who sleep on the warmer side, as linen remains extra breathable and cool through the night. Bamboo: Typically, bamboo sheets are made by turning the bamboo plant into viscose (aka rayon). Like linen, the material gets softer over time the more it's washed, although you can purchase a pair that has been stone-washed, and they’ll be a bit softer than the rest. Bamboo sheets are a great eco-friendly buy because they use a lot less water than cotton while being manufactured, and bamboo grows faster. They're a good choice for hot sleepers as they tend to be more breathable. Jersey: While jersey sheets may not work for those who prefer to sleep on the cooler side since they tend to keep in warmth, they are a cult favorite. Jersey is a type of knit cotton that's buttery soft and tends to be a more affordable option, too. Flannel: Flannel sheets are especially popular in the winter because they’re notorious for being extremely soft and warm. They're typically made from cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers. Add some to your cart if you’re all about that cozy feel and you're not much of a hot sleeper. Tencel: Not only is this a cellulose fiber made from sustainably sourced wood more eco-friendly than cotton, but it’s also softer on the skin. In addition, it retains color better than other soft fabrics like cotton, and because it absorbs moisture, it’s another smart option for hot sleepers. Eucalyptus: Eucalyptus sheets are eco-friendly and breathable, making them a good choice for hot sleepers who want to reduce their environmental impact. According to Buffy , Eucalyptus uses 76 percent less water than cotton to produce, and it's cool to the touch. Microfiber: Microfiber is another extremely affordable option that doesn't sacrifice softness. For instance, reviewers have praised Mellanni's ever-popular brushed microfiber sheets for getting softer with every wash, all for around $35. Silk: Silk sheets can be hard to find and extremely expensive, but let’s face it: when it comes to softness, silk takes the cake. If you’re obsessed with that slippery, luxe feel and have the budget for it, why not treat yourself? But if you can’t splurge on the whole set, snag silk pillowcases , which, by the way, are good for your hair and skin. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Why Trust House Beautiful? When it comes to picking out the best (and most affordable) pieces for any bedroom, including my own, I have been reviewing bedding for nearly eight years, having access to more than a few stylish samples. I currently have eight sets of sheets, so who better to write about the softest ones on the market? I'd also say that I'm on a never-ending quest to maximize the comfort and look of my bedroom, so you can trust that I have done my homework to find the best and most beloved pieces on the market. Not to mention, I have covered everything from the best linen sheets to top-notch silk pillowcases to reviews on sheet sets like Cozy Earth . For this story, I and several other House Beautiful editors spent weeks, and even years, sleeping on dozens of top-rated sheets to determine the softest options on the market right now.

As any interior designer will probably suggest, the most stylish homes are the layered ones that mix high and low . That said, inexpensive home decor shouldn't be obvious. Everything, both the expensive pieces and the more affordable ones , should blend and create a cohesive aesthetic that feels lived-in and loved. So, if you're wondering where to buy cheap furniture and accessories that don't exactly reflect their easy-on-the-wallet price tags, you've come to the right place. Ahead, we are sharing our favorite brands that sell plenty of budget-friendly finds that look much more luxurious than they are. Some of these retailers—Amazon, Wayfair, and Walmart—you likely already know, but we're also offering quite a few names with which you may not be familiar (yet). So, go ahead and peruse our carefully curated list and shop for anything your home could be lacking. Whether you snag a piece of art , a duvet cover , or anything in between, you'll be relieved to know it won't cost an arm or a leg. It may even cost under $100 . The best part? You may even be able to score everything you need from the same place. Otherwise, look around all of our favorite spots for some of the most stylish pieces that are shockingly affordable. Shop more budget-friendly home products. The Best Couches Under $500 Are More Stylish Than You'd Expect Interior Designers Reveal Where They Shop for Affordable Home Decor 15 Cheap Bed Frames You'd Never Guess Are Less Than $300 Minna MINNA "I discovered Minna at Scribner's Catskills Lodge . The brand's gorgeous throw pillows are in all of the common spaces and the guest rooms. I loved the pillows so much that I ordered three before I left the property," Associate Shopping Editor Jessica Cherner says. The brand, which is based in Hudson, New York, sells everything decor-related, including blankets, wallpaper, vases, and, of course, pillows. Shop Minna Williams Sonoma Williams Sonoma Williams Sonoma is the destination for all things kitchen, including entertaining, cooking, and more, so if you are looking to outfit the heart of your home with stylish finds from myriad brands, including Aerin, this is the best place to look. Score everything from small kitchen appliances to serveware. Shop Williams Sonoma Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Afloral Afloral We'll start by saying that Afloral is not a home decor brand. As its name implies, it's an online florist that sells, for the most part, flowers and plants. However, it does carry a few beautiful vessels for those plants and flowers. They're all unique, making them hard to find somewhere else, which is why we put Afloral on the list. Shop Afloral Amazon AMAZON Yes, Amazon is where you get books, sponges, lightbulbs, and everything else you'd need on a dime. However, did you know the enormous e-tailer that sells millions of products also carries plenty of design-forward small businesses? This vase is easily one of our favorite things we've found on the site. Shop Amazon Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Article Article You could furnish your entire home with Article pieces because the brand sells furniture, decor, and everything in between. We'll be the first to say that it's not cheap, but it's definitely not calling for luxury prices. If your style falls more in the minimalist camp, you'll love Article because pretty much everything is neutral in color, touchably soft, and devoid of any unnecessary ornamentation. Shop Article Crate & Barrel Crate & Barrel "When I moved, I had a self-inflicted budget, which was tricky because I wanted fancy, comfortable pieces that would last a long time. I landed on Crate & Barrel because it has incredible sales all the time, so I could get a luxury sofa, media console, and rug without going over my budget," Cherner says. Crate & Barrel is like the perfect halfway point between maximalist and minimalist because everything—from the furniture to the accessories—has plenty of personality, but nothing is too overpowering. Shop Crate & Barrel Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Burrow Burrow Burrow sells plenty of furniture, but it's most famous for its collection of classic sofas, which, for the most part, are modular, so you can get almost anything and configure it to fit your space. So, if you're working within a small space, but don't want to spend your money on something tiny and uncomfortable, Burrow is a great place to start your search for the perfect couch. Shop Burrow Joss & Main Joss & Main Joss & Main is actually owned by Wayfair, but, unlike its parent company, is its own brand and boasts its own specific style. We'd call it California-cool because the palette is generally soft and pale neutrals, with none of the pieces being too fussy or delicate. In other words, there's a subtle emphasis on a natural backdrop. Shop Joss & Main Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Tempaper tempaper "I love Tempaper. I just do. It's such an incredible brand that is basically made for people who are not crafty, but like doing things themselves," Cherner explains. "I bought a peel-and-stick wallpaper from Tempaper for my former apartment and loved the process of installing it so much that I bought another wallpaper from the brand and created an accent wall in my bedroom. Both lasted for three-plus years. I ended up having to take it down before moving out. Otherwise, I'd leave it up forever." Shop Tempaper Parachute Parachute " Parachute is like if your favorite hotel sold its luxury sheets for a fraction of the price. Yes, the brand sells other things, but it's most beloved, we'd say, for its bedding," Cherner says. The brand sells percale, flannel, linen, brushed cotton, and more. Plus, as of 2024, Parachute carries a mattress and plush toppers. Shop Parachute Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Castlery Castlery Castlery reminds us of Burrow in that it carries a lot of furniture, but most people familiar with the brand knew about the sofas before they knew about the cool coffee tables, bookshelves, and throw pillows. That said, everything from Castlery is cool, comfy, and on trend. Shop Castlery Schoolhouse Schoolhouse Schoolhouse is one of those brands that you may not have known about until you were redecorating and doing a lot of research, but once you happen upon it, you'll feel like you need everything. It has kind of a Pacific Northwest look, but the brand is versatile enough to work in any home anywhere. The brand's whole thing is American-inspired heirloom pieces that don't cost heirloom prices. Shop Schoolhouse Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Walmart Walmart Walmart may be where you get groceries and toilet paper, but it's also a great place to score affordable furniture and decor. Case in point: These chairs , which look like they could be from a luxury furniture brand, but are actually less than $175. You may have to hunt around to find the stylish pieces, but rest assured, if you put in the work, you'll discover some great stuff. Shop Walmart Rejuvenation Rejuvenation We'll be the first to admit: Rejuvenation is not a super affordable brand. However, there are so many pieces that are shockingly cheap. Similar to Walmart, it requires a few minutes of work to find these pieces, but once you do, buy them ASAP because they tend to sell out. Shop Rejuvenation Advertisement - Continue Reading Below H&M h&m H&M mostly sells clothes and fashion accessories, which you've probably noticed if you've ever walked by the store. That said, H&M Home, which launched back in 2009, sells tons of beautiful, minimalist home decor, including dinnerware, bedding, space-saving solutions, and more. Shop H&M West Elm West Elm Anyone with an affinity for the midcentury modern era but doesn't want to spend the sometimes exorbitant prices on authentic pieces from the time, welcome to West Elm. All of the furniture is inspired by the post-war period, but it's made for 21st-century living. Some of the bigger pieces are contract-grade, in fact, so you know it will last through some wear and tear. Shop West Elm Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Pottery Barn Pottery Barn "I didn't find everything at Crate & Barrel. I couldn't find nightstands I liked anywhere , so I popped into Pottery Barn just to see if they had anything that tickled my fancy, and I found these nightstands," Cherner says. "They were already relatively affordable, but they were also on sale, so without even really thinking about it, I bought two and have never looked back. Pottery Barn has so many incredible, albeit quite traditional, furniture and decor that works well with any style." Shop Pottery Barn Frontgate Frontgate Generally speaking, Frontgate is a luxury furniture brand, but because it's all online and sells thousands of pieces it often needs to offload, there are a lot of sales. We're not talking a measly 10 percent off here and there. No, we're talking sometimes thousands of dollars off luxury pieces. Our favorite items to shop, though, are the accessories, like the Mongolian fur decorative pillow covers. Shop Frontgate Advertisement - Continue Reading Below AllModern AllModern As its name implies, AllModern's pieces, which range from under $50 accessories to more luxuriously priced furniture, is inspired by the midcentury modern era. So, if you have coveted a certain sofa, lamp, or anything else from that era, but don't want to spend so much money on it, you may be able to find a good dupe here. Shop AllModern Food52 Food52 Calling all home chefs, hosts, and hostesses: We challenge you to click around on Food52 and not buy something. Whether you're shopping the Food52 brand or any of the others available on the site, you'll love whatever you buy. "I bought a cake stand from here during the pandemic when I was baking non-stop, and I still use it all the time. Truly, this is one of the best places to get cool, kind of kitschy kitchen goods for less," Cherner says.

By Samantha Jones Published: Jan 11, 2024 1:23 PM EST Save Article Jeff Spicer Every item on this page was hand-picked by a House Beautiful editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. If you love seeing the inside of your favorite celebrity's home , you're not alone. How they decorate the place or what they use to organize their pantry can provide helpful inspiration for our own spaces. So when Blake Lively posted a sneak peek of her New York City bedroom on Instagram, this editor took notes when it came to her cozy bedding. With a little internet sleuthing (thank you Lively for tagging all the brands in your photo), we discovered both her duvet cover and sheet sets are from The Citizenry. View full post on Instagram The exact duvet style, if you wish to recreate her rustic and organic vibes in your own home, is called stonewashed linen in olive green. We love the subtle texture and warm, inviting hue of this piece. According to the brand, it's made from French flax and woven in a family-run linen mill in Portugal, then garment-washed for an airy and super-soft texture. Complete with hidden button closure and interior ties, the duvet cover is designed to prevent the comforter inside from shifting around should you toss and turn at night. And while Lively opted for an olive green hue, The Citizenry offers it in 14 different colors to match your own design style. Stonewashed Linen Duvet Cover $289 at The Citizenry For those who don't need a duvet cover, but are interested in sheets, you can buy The Citizenry's stonewashed linen sheets from the same collection. House Beautiful editors actually included this exact set in our best linen sheets of 2023 list due to their lightweight feel, inviting texture, and the brand's eco-conscious practices. If you prefer to copy Lively's bedding preferences to a T though, they're either the organic matte sateen in dune style or the heirloom linen sheets in bone from Morrow Soft Goods. Note that to fully achieve her rustic aesthetic, you'll want to also have exposed beams, wrought iron accents, ornate chandeliers, and even gold wall sconces in your home. If this is not feasible, her duvet cover and sheets will work just fine, so grab them before they're out-of-stock.

Soumi Sarkar Shopping Furniture The Best Leather Sofas for Every Type of Space The Best Leather Sofas for Every Type of Space From vintage to faux, here are some stylish options. By Jessica Cherner Published: Jun 11, 2024 Save Article As shopping editors, we always say that a high price is usually correlated to quality, meaning the better the materials, the bigger the expense. That definitely rings true for the best leather sofas, which are usually made with the two highest leather qualities: full- and top-grain . That said, a few of the super-soft leather couches on our list are on the pricey side while the rest are more affordable. That's because these pieces are made with a blend of leathers or even faux leather, which cuts down the price point  for those seeking out inexpensive furniture . Best Overall Leather Sofa Burrow Arch Nomad Leather Sectional Read more Best Value Leather Sofa Hcore Faux Leather Futon Read more Best L-Shape Leather Sofa Pottery Barn Pearce 3-Piece L-Shape Sectional Read more Here's the thing, though: There is nothing wrong with a sofa that is not made with 100 percent high-quality leather, especially if you’re not looking to spend a few thousand dollars on your couch . The only potential downside with lower-grade leather is that it likely won’t last as long, which is totally okay for those who don’t necessarily want to sit on the same couch for a decade. So, if you’re eager to discover the best leather sofas on offer, take a peek at our list below. Some of these picks are in House Beautiful editors’ homes, so you know they're good. Keep reading to see all of our favorite finds and some tips on buying and caring for leather furniture.

When it came time to choose one for our apartment, I went with Burrow's Nomad model because it was marketed towards people living in small apartments (me) and it looked modern, which is the vibe of my current space," says Senior Commerce Editor Marina Liao. "I like that the sofa can be configured however you like. We opted for the removable chaise to make the three-seater into an L-shape, so that someone could lie down while watching TV." Modular configurations are ideal for anyone not ready to commit to an L-shape because you can put the chaise on either end, so if you know you're not in your forever home, go with a modular sofa. "The leather is buttery smooth and despite all the guests who have sat, and slept, on the sofa, there are no cracks or scratches on the leather! Whenever friends ask me for a leather couch recommendation, I definitely say, if you have the budget, Burrow is by far one of the best high quality options for small-space living," Liao adds. Best Value Leather Sofa Hcore Faux Leather Futon Now 36% Off $160 at Amazon Pros Available in multiple colors Comfortable for sleeping Easy assembly Cons Relatively shallow seat (28 inches) For anyone who may think otherwise, a comfy futon is definitely a type of sofa, so we are adding this stylish midcentury-inspired option to the list. It comes in 14 colors, including this bright white. If you're worried it will get filthy, know that it's faux leather, which makes it a lot easier to clean. Liquids and oils definitely won't affect this material the way it would real leather. It's also what makes the sofa a lot more affordable. "This took like five minutes to put together. It's very sturdy and comfortable. I have hip and back issues and this is awesome. I can sit on it or lay on it all day!" one reviewer said . Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best L-Shape Leather Sofa Pottery Barn Pearce 3-Piece L-Shape Sectional $8,297 at Pottery Barn Pros Available in more than 40 colors Free white glove delivery Down-blend-filled cushions Cons Most colors take up to 12 weeks to ship If this molasses-hued leather couch is a little too dark for your space, rest assured. It comes in a whopping 42 additional colors. Think denim blue, camel, saddle, and more. The only downside to the insane amount of color options it that, because there are so many, Pottery Barn only has a mere few in stock and ready to ship. The others can take up to 12 weeks to both make and ship. We'd say that this couch is worth the wait, though. It's features a deep seat that's filled with a down-blend to make it sink-in soft. Trust us; movie nights on this thing will become your favorite ritual of the week. Did we mention that white glove delivery is included? Best Faux Leather Sofa Dreamsir Faux Leather Sofa $400 at Amazon Pros Wide enough for three people Available in multiple colors Pet-friendly material Cons Some reviewers say the material is very glossy We're taking a short break from the luxury options to discuss a more affordable alternative. This Dreamsir two-seater screams the 1960s, which is why we love it. Plus, if you're not into animal products but like the look and feel of a leather couch, you'll appreciate that this one is made entirely of faux leather, meaning no animals were harmed in the process. It comes in six cool shades, including this midnight blue, which is our personal favorite. Lastly, we call it a two-seater because it's complete with two large cushions, but at 80 inches wide, you can squeeze at least three on here comfortably. "First off, this couch arrived several days ahead of schedule, which was nice. The couch itself is perfect," one reviewer said . "It was super easy assembly. The faux leather is heavy and good quality, with quality stitched seams. The solid wood legs seem quite sturdy, too." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Low-Profile Leather Sofa Arhaus Madrone Leather Sofa Now 15% Off $3,399 at Arhaus Pros Available in two colors Deep seat Easy to clean and care for Cons Color may fade in direct sunlight Sadly, the cushions aren't removable, but that's because they basically are the frame. The whole sofa is padded with fiber-wrapped dense foam, which means every inch (with the exception of the two inches of exposed wooden legs) is a cozy spot to lean and lounge on. The real draw, though, is in the shape. It's undeniably a low-profile silhouette with track arms and deep seating. It's definitely a look. Get it in graphite (pictured) or camel. You can't go wrong with either. One word of caution though, no matter which color you get: Due to the nature of leather, placing this sofa in direct sunlight will cause it to fade, so try to put it as far from the window as possible. Most Durable Leather Sofa Mercury Row Alissa Upholstered Sofa $350 at Wayfair Pros Resistant to stains, tears, and fading Both colors available in suede Easy assembly Cons Color options are both warm-toned browns Available in both leather and suede, this Mercury Row sofa is one of our favorites. The fact that it's only $350 is just icing on top. If you're looking for something affordable, you can't go wrong with this piece because it's not a massive financial or spatial commitment. "I love this Alissa couch. The sofa was wrapped exceptionally well and the material is soft while the seating is very comfortable. It fills well in my little home," a five-star review said . The best part, we think, is the fact that the upholstery is so durable. According to the brand, it's resistant to stains, tears, and fading, so feel free to stick it in the sunniest corner of your home and let your dogs and cats rest on it whenever they please. Nothing can harm this adorable sofa.

Anyone with traditionally designed interiors can do themselves and their living room a favor by adding this gorgeous and cozy piece to the mix because it's both comfortable and contract-grade, so it's literally built to last. Unlike some of the other options on the list, this piece doesn't have a removable, plush cushion for added comfort. Instead, it's a combination of polyester-wrapped foam and and-tied coil springs, which makes it a bit on the firmer side, but highly comfy, depending on what you tend to gravitate towards. Best Leather Sofa for Small Spaces Crate & Barrel Wells Leather Apartment Sofa Now 35% Off $1,949 at Crate & Barrel Pros Available in multiple colors Very soft and smooth leather Small space-friendly Cons Leather may wrinkle As you can see from the photo, the sofa is definitely small space-friendly, so if you're working within tight confines, you can't go wrong with this piece. It comes in three widths: 72, 84, and 103 inches, so if you are looking for something for a slightly larger living room, you have options. "I helped my brother decorate his tiny New York City studio several years ago and this was the easiest piece to land on. It's extremely soft and the cushioning is sink-in cozy," Associate Shopping Editor Jessica Cherner says. "It also came in a camel color, but I thought the gray was a bit more unique. Plus, it went with his palette better. Both, though, are so beautiful and you really can't go wrong. This is absolutely my favorite piece on the whole list. The fact that Crate & Barrel still sells it so many years later is also a testament to how good it is." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Leather Sofa Deal Frontgate Logan Chesterfield Sofa Now 20% Off $3,599 at Frontgate Pros $900 off Available in more than 50 fabrics Free white glove delivery Cons 140 pounds We are big Chesterfield fans over at House Beautiful , so including only one on our list felt like a slight. Here's our second pick, which, like the centuries-old originals, is upholstered in dark leather and features rolled arms and deep tufting. Unlike the previous Chesterfield, this one can squeeze into even the smallest living rooms, so if you want to add a touch of traditionalism to your space, this is a good get. Like most furniture from Frontgate, this comes with white glove delivery. Did we mention that it's nearly $1,000 off right now? Easiest Leather Sofa to Care For Latitude Run Rebba Sofa Now 5% Off $486 at Wayfair Pros Available in multiple colors Bolster pillows included Looks and feels like real leather Cons Difficult assembly Is it just us or are there a lot of blue leather sofas out there? It's making us think that blue is the new brown when it comes to furniture, and we are absolutely here for it. This beautiful tufted couch is actually finished in faux leather, making it more affordable and easier to clean than the real thing. It also doesn't require any moisturizing or extra care, so if you don't want anything too precious, get this. One reviewer said : "It's not that plastic-rubber stretchy faux leather that we are used to, but it definitely looks like leather in terms of texture. I think whatever sheen they coated it with makes the couch easy to wipe clean." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Colored Leather Sofa AllModern Julio Leather Sofa Now 15% Off $2,199 at AllModern Pros Free white glove delivery Ships within two days Filled with foam on all sides Cons Needs to be moisturized monthly to keep leather soft This AllModern piece kind of reminds us of the Arhaus option we included earlier on the list. This one, of course, is for anyone who wants a punchier color in their space. "It's a great couch! Looks and feels great, as pictured and fits well in the home. Perfect for small folks like myself," a reviewer said . It also works for taller people since it's 87 inches wide and nearly 40 inches deep. Best Quality Leather Sofa West Elm Axel Leather Sofa Now 4% Off $2,399 at West Elm Pros Genuine top-grain leather Available in multiple sizes Contract-grade Cons Ships within five weeks West Elm's Axel sofa comes in three sizes that range from 60 to 89 inches, so whether you're looking to decorate a small space or a sprawling living room, this couch will definitely get the job done. The selling point is definitely the genuine top-grain leather, which is thick and soft, making it super cozy to cuddle up on. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Best Vintage Leather Sofa Cini Boeri for Knoll Brigadiere Sofa $3,950 at 1stDibs Pros Authenticated vintage Well-maintained Lacquered wood frame Cons Expensive international shipping (from the Netherlands) We don't want to say we saved one of the best for last, but we won't deny it either. This gorgeous Cini Boeri for Knoll sofa would easily be the talking point in any living room because it's an authentic vintage sofa that is basically the furniture representation of the space-age modern era. This piece was produced in Italy in 1976, so it definitely is the real thing. Plus, for being nearly 50 years old, it looks very good for its age! How We Chose the Best Leather Sofas For this story, I spent 10-plus hours researching the best leather sofas on the market. To kick off my product search, I turned to the House Beautiful editors to find out if any of my colleagues have and love their leather couches. To my delight and surprise (most of us live in New York City where space is a premium), a few of our editors have solid recommendations that live in their own apartments. I also included my brother's leather couch because I can attest that it's incredible. As for the remaining products on the list, I turned to my trusty friend, the Internet. I read hundreds of reviews to find the best of the best. Not to mention, I wanted to find the best options in terms of both functionality and looks, which is why every option on our list is both utility-forward and gorgeous. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below What Is the Best Leather Quality for a Couch? We always tend to say that the high price of furniture is often due to the materials used, which tend to be higher quality with expensive pieces. When it comes to leather couches, that is definitely true. The best leather quality for a couch is undeniably full-grain leather, which is basically an unprepared hide that goes right to the tanning process. Not only is this type of leather thick and durable, but it ages well with use and time. You don't have to worry about treating or buffing it because the natural tightness of the grain will protect it against common offenses, like moisture. The only downside is the price. Any furniture upholstered in full-grain leather will not come cheap. If you don't want to spend too much, but still opt for a good-quality leather couch, go with top-grain leather, which is, as its name implies, the top layer of the hide that gets sanded, buffed, or shaved in preparation for whatever type of finish the designer wants. Most handbags are made with top-grain leather because it's easier to dye. Like full-grain leather, it isn't exactly cheap, but it's more affordable than full-grain. It's also prone to scratches, so if you like the brand-new look, you may want to just bite the bullet and go for full-grain. What Are the Downsides of a Leather Sofa? Leather is a great material for furniture because, for the most part, it is easy to care for and doesn't actually require much maintenance (if you go for high-quality grains). There are a few downsides, though. Depending on the type of leather you choose, it can be really expensive. And if you aren't willing to spend a few thousand dollars on your leather couch, you may be faced with other disadvantages, including fading, cracking, scratching, and more. Because leather—even lower quality leather—is still skin, it will be prone to all of the problems your own skin faces. Not to mention, if you go for a couch that's made of bonded leather, you may notice some peeling where you sit the most because there's only about 20 percent actual leather in the material. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below How Do You Tell If the Leather Is Good Quality? Unless you're buying a vintage, antique, or used leather sofa, you can easily find out the type of leather used, which will indicate the quality. New sofas should include information about the material. Otherwise, there are a few ways to discover the leather quality without a tag or product background. First is the smell. If you've ever walked into a leather shop, you were probably bombarded by a very strong scent, which most people find pleasant. Take a sniff of the leather sofa to figure out the quality: If it does, indeed, smell of rich leather, it's good quality. If there's no scent, it's probably bonded or faux leather. The next step is to touch the leather with your finger: Like your own skin, it should stretch and slightly wrinkle. It's not perfectly smooth, but it should be relatively pliable. If the leather just dimples beneath your finger, it may not be high-quality leather. The last step may be a little tricky to pull off if you're at a store, but it works: Drip a tiny bit of water onto the sofa. Real leather will absorb it (no stains) and faux leather will let it sit there on the surface until you wipe it away. Why Trust House Beautiful? I may not be a professional interior designer, but as someone who has worked in the editorial design space for nearly a decade and decorated four apartments since graduating college, I know what makes a good sofa, where to find it, and how to buy one. Plus, I've written about and recommended couches on more than a few occasions. From the best cheap sofas to the House Beautiful editor-approved ones that actually live in our homes, I've covered all things couches. It was only a matter of time before I delved into what's considered by some to be one of the most classic sofa materials of all time: a leather couch. For this story, I spent over 10-plus hours combing through reviews, ratings, and tapped my fellow editors to find the best leather sofas on the market right now for House Beautiful readers.

By regularly cleaning and caring for your leather upholstery, your furniture can maintain its beautiful lister and give you a lifetime of enjoyment. If you want to ensure its longevity, here are a few important tips you should keep in mind when caring for leather. Always be sure to protect your leather from fading or drying. This means keeping leather furniture away from direct sunlight if possible and making sure your home is humidified during those cold winter months. Although treated leathers… How long have you been in business? We have been in business for a successful 60 years and with your help, we plan to continue to thrive as a family operated business for many more years. Do you have qualified sales consultants to assist in my decision making? Yes, we have many experienced consultants on staff to help you make a choice in our showroom or in your home or office. Do you deliver outside of Essex County? Yes, we do ship to all points in Canada and the United States. We have been doing this since inception – 1962. Do you offer an interest free payment plan? Yes, we offer different interest free payment plans throughout the year depending on the sale running. We do not charge any administration or signing fees. Only Canadian customers can qualify for this Do you custom order? Yes we do custom orders. As a matter of fact, more than half of our business consists of such. Wood products such as dining rooms, bedroom and dinettes can be ordered in numerous stains and finishes. Our upholstery can also be ordered in a variety of fabrics as well as leathers, to best suit your needs. Do you offer a layaway plan? Yes, we offer a layaway plan of up to one year with a deposit and regular payments. Very convenient to do, and of course no interest or service charges. Canadian and U.S. customers can qualify for this service. Do I have to pay sales tax on my purchase if I am a Michigan resident?

Please bear in mind that due to the handmade nature of our products these are only estimates and are not guaranteed. For large items we offer our very own two-man delivery and installation service to ensure that your precious new furniture arrives safely and is installed correctly so you can get on with enjoying it! Our furniture delivery & installation service includes: - A specialist 2 person delivery team Flexible delivery scheduling to suit you A 2-3 hour delivery slot.* Track the progress of your delivery on the day A call one hour before they arrive, if requested. Installation of your furniture in the room of your choice. Removal of all packaging for recycling and no mess left behind. If you require a weekend or evening delivery we can do that too. Please let us know ahead of time and we can arrange it for you for a small surcharge. *While we do everything in our power to stick rigidly to the quoted delivery slot sometimes events out of our control can affect the time frame, we will however keep in touch to ensure you’re always updated with our estimated time of arrival. For Smaller Items We typically deliver orders within 7 - 14 days subject to stock availability. If items are out of stock, we will notify you and confirm expected delivery timescales. The standard delivery option takes place weekdays at any time between 8am and 6pm. If you need your item quickly, please let us know and we'll do our very best to meet your needs. When your order is being prepared for dispatch, we'll email you. If delivery takes longer, we'll contact you to confirm an ETA. When your furniture is delivered As soon as your item(s) arrive, please check them thoroughly. It's rare, but items can get damaged in transit. Please let us know within 24 hours of receiving your item of any damage so that we can collect and replace the item(s) quickly for free. We operate a 14 day returns policy. If, for any reason you wish to return your item(s), just let us know within 14 days of receiving your order and we'll start the return. You can return it yourself, or have us collect it for a fee that can be deducted from the final refund. You must keep the items' packaging until you know you'll be keeping them . Furniture/Item Assembly Courier Services - Some items may require minor assembly - we're sorry our courier-partner drivers cannot assist with this due to insurance purposes and time constraints. If you have any questions about the assembly requirements of your item, just get in touch before purchasing. We strongly suggest you check every part of items that require minor assembly before you construct them or dispose/recycle any packaging. L+J Delivery & Installation Service - If you choose for our delivery and installation service our experienced delivery teams will assemble you item into the room of your choice and take away any packaging for recycling. Prefer to collect your order? That's ok, you can either collect from Derbyshire warehouse (by prior appointment) weekdays between 10am and 4pm. Smaller items can be arranged to be collected from our Birmingham Showroom. Please bear in mind the location of the showroom is in The Mailbox shopping centre so any items would need to be carried some distance back to your vehicle. We may need to undertake additional address verification checks prior to collection of orders paid for by debit or credit cards. When items are collected, they will have been checked and assumed to have been collected in perfect condition. We cannot accept any responsibility if the item is found to be subsequently damaged following its arrival at the final destination if we didn’t deliver it . Flexible Ways To Pay Pay YOUR way with our flexible payment options Debit/Credit Cards - We accept all major credit and debit cards and include fast ways to pay like PayPal Apple Pay and GPay.

Hassle-FREE Returns Hassle-FREE 14 Days Returns We're confident that you'll fall in love with your item as soon as it arrives. But if, for any reason you wish to return an item, you may do so within 14 days of receiving your item for a full refund (except for bespoke and made-to-order pieces). To cancel or return your order, please email us . Returned items must be in a resalable condition (for example not have been partly or fully assembled, or incurred any damage when hung on a wall) and you are responsible for their safe return including the cost of postage . We can collect for a pre-agreed fee (usually £15 - £49 depending on item size/weight/fragility) or you can arrange to return items yourself. We will replace items that arrive faulty or damaged for free. If you decide you do not want a fault-free replacement item, the item will be considered an unwanted item and you will be liable for the return cost. If a product arrives damaged, or we made an error, and it cannot be remedied with either a full replacement or replacement parts, we will pay to return the item to us. Accepted Returns We will only accept returns if items have all of their original packaging as that is how we can ensure the item is adequately protected on its way back to us. If items are not returned in their complete original packaging, a 20% packaging fee may be charged - this represents the price reduction that a future buyer will expect for an item without its packaging. Further reductions to the refund may be made if the item shows signs of use or damage. If you cancel an order that has already been shipped, or if we fail to deliver an order because you are not at home or there are access difficulties that we have not been made aware of in advance, we may deduct delivery costs from the refund owed. Cancelling discounted orders If a discount was provided when you placed your order, we'll have provided this based on you spending a certain amount with us. If any part of the discounted order is subsequently returned, this will lower your spend with us and therefore may make you ineligible for the discount. As such, we reserve the right to remove the whole discount provided on your full order from the refund you are due. Please contact us to discuss this if you wish to return part of a discounted order.

A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. “When she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson – Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.” The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view. Fabrication Made using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request. The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt’s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.

Wood will shrink and expand across the grain so the depth may vary by a few millimetres (1/4") UK Free Shipping Shipping is free to most UK mainland addresses. For international shipping details click here . Most furniture takes around 6-8 weeks to be ready to send. We will contact you when it's ready so that we can arrange a convenient delivery day. Large items will be delivered using a courier service who can bring it in to a room of choice.  Very large, heavy items will be delivered by a 2-person courier team if this service is available to your postcode. Courier delivery unfortunately isn't available to Northern Ireland, some remote postcodes in Wales, Scotland and England or any offshore addresses. For areas not covered by our courier we can package your order on a pallet and ship it with a parcel service. This will incur a surcharge starting at £40 for smaller furniture items. This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message here if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you. This usually costs £35. Please remember to provide a contact telephone number at checkout. All couriers require this and without it, we can't send your furniture!

To see the shipping cost add a product to your cart and then use the shipping calculator at the bottom of the Cart page. You can remove it from your Cart at any time. Europe (EU) :  we ship with duty and taxes payable by us, not by you, so you won't pay any more to import our furniture into your country. We will handle all the paperwork at our end so it's as easy and hassle free for you as possible. You just pay the shipping costs added at checkout. USA : there is no duty or tax to pay, just the shipping costs added at checkout.

Europe (non-EU) : you will need to pay import duty and taxes but the shipping cost will be free at checkout. Canada/Australia/Others : shipping will be added at checkout, or contact us to get a shipping quote, you will also have to pay any duties, fees or taxes which are applicable for customs imports into your country. If shipping isn't showing as available to your location don't worry, we can still send it, but we'll need to do a custom quote. Just message us with the product/size you're looking for and we'll get back to you with a price. Items will be sent with an international delivery company (usually UPS, TNT/Fedex or DHL). Unfortunately we can't arrange delivery on a specific day but we will send tracking details as soon as it has been dispatched. You will then be able to contact the delivery company to schedule/reschedule delivery. Delivery takes 3-10 days from the day of dispatch depending on your location and custom clearance times. Delivery is to the street door, so ensure you have someone available to help if you are ordering a large, heavy item. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple stacked wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. ARE YOU IN THE EU? Find answers to Brexit delivery questions HERE .

We believe in the quality of our products, which is why, unlike other furniture retailers, we offer exclusive 5 year warranties for chairs, bar stools and tables in residential settings. We feel that we would be doing a “dis service” to the Australian public if we didn’t stand by our products and give you a 5 year warranty when most furniture retailers will only give you 1 to 2 years. Not to mention we offer regular wear and tear coverage on all chairs and bar stools which is a first for any Australia retailer. If you are dissatisfied with what you receive (though we doubt it!), we’ll give you a full refund - no questions asked. SHOP DINING CHAIRS NOW → 5 Year Warranty Regular Wear & Tear

It was very easy to assemble and didn’t take too long to assemble, about an hour with two people that weren’t in a rush. For only $90, it looks pretty nice and the rattan makes it look more expensive than it is. My ONLY CON/NEGATIVE is thay the top plywood where the TV rests curves with the TV weighing on it. It’s not too TOO noticeable but you can see the slight curve in the middle if you stare. But for $90, I’m not sweating about it. Maybe adding our TV’s feet/legs will alleviate this issue.

Fairly easy to put together however the “boho” facade on the front is attached with spray adhesive. The Florida heat had caused the adhesive to release & required some repair. It was an easy fix so the piece is still worth the price. I love the aesthetic for a boho beach guest room. I wouldn’t sit on this but it’s a great TV stand.

Product Description Personal style is expressive and can be transformative - nowhere is that more apparent than inside your home. For Mid-Century Modern décor enthusiasts, the Novogratz Brittany Futon is a game-changing multifunctional furniture piece that will set your living room, home office, or guest room apart from the rest. Part futon couch, part futon bed, it takes a convertible approach to relaxed living with a lowerable folding back that shifts into small sleeper bed form whenever your guests are in need and an easy push-pull split-back mechanism that expands your seating choices for versatile sitting, lounging, and sleeping comfort. Uniquely designed with ribbed channel tufting on the backrest, curved armrests, and 4 slanted solid wood legs that are felt-lined for floor protection, the Brittany's foam cushioned seat and padded arms provide a firm foundation for rest, as do its small-space plywood frame build with supportive no-sag spring backing, 2 plastic center legs, and 2 concealed fold-out support legs located within rear zippered pockets. Offered in multiple colors, the Brittany is available in both easy-to-clean linen look and faux leather upholstery options.

I’m using it in an office just for some seating if I want to relax. It’s pretty sturdy but the texture of the fabric is not the most soft. The size is great for me. I fit just right and I’m a 5’10 male. Any taller then you wouldn’t be able to fully stretch out. It was easy to put together. Although the smell of the couch is bad like chemicals. I’m sure it will go away over time. All in all I do recommend this couch because for its looks, price, and function as a futon. So if this is your budget then go for it but if you have a bigger budget, you might wanna find something that’s more comfortable.

Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024 Color: Blue Style: Futon Verified Purchase I was blown away by the quality of this sofa for the price. When I purchased mine, there was a promotion so I actually paid less than $200 for this model. It arrived in a single compact box which had me worried at first, but when I unpacked this sofa I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the material. (The engineering behind the packing and couch design deserve recognition, it’s the most efficient thing I’ve seen in a long time) In a nutshell, I am completely satisfied with this futon. The material is soft and durable, the sofa is comfortable to sit on after long periods of time, and it’s designed to turn into a bed! The style and aesthetic perfectly matches our home, and it was incredibly easy to assemble. It took me less than 30 minutes to assemble by myself, and it seats 3 people comfortably. I hope this blue color becomes available again soon! I could really use another one. Read more Lucky 🍀 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sofa for the price… plus it’s a futon bed!

Images in this review 7 people found this helpful Helpful Report Hannah 4.0 out of 5 stars Stylish - Not The Most Comfortable Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023 Color: Camel Faux Leather Style: Futon Verified Purchase I got this couch last month, and to preface my review, I will say that I needed this piece for furnishing my first apartment and I am confined to a VERY tight budget. So I was looking for the cheapest couch possible that still looked nice. Overall I am satisfied with my first ever couch, but excited for the day when I can afford a nice, high quality, real leather, and comfortable couch, and give this one to someone in need. So if you can afford to get a better couch than this one, I would recommend to just bite the bullet and invest in a better couch. You will regret your purchase if you had more money to spend on a couch and got this one instead. I simply couldn't afford a nicer couch. First, I'll start off with the cons: If you are looking for a comfortable couch and that is your #1 priority in buying a couch, this is not the couch for you. Just pay more for comfort. Seriously. It will be worth it for you. If you are looking for a quality couch that will last a long time, this is not the couch for you. For example, the arms are held in place by 3 bolts at the bottom, and so when people lean their bodyweight on the arm (most people I know sit this way), you can tell its not meant to support that type of lounging because it moves and creaks a little lol. My sister slept over on the couch and she said that she would have been more comfortable if I had a sleeping pad, so I'll have to invest in one of those for my guests. Keep in mind, she's a side sleeper and this is a firm couch. Might be better if you sleep on your back, but still, the couch is not as padded as I thought it would be. I was expecting the padding to be firm because that's what I saw from reviews, but it doesn’t seem as substantial as I'd hoped. I thought the foam was going to be more dense? Idk how else to describe it, but that is something that surprised me a little was how "hollow" the seats feel. Like eventually with more wear I'll just fall through. Even with how cheap it is, I wasn't expecting the seats to feel like that. Oh well. To end my review on a positive note... Pros: This couch was easy to assemble, I am pregnant and was able to do it all by myself easily within an hour or 2. The instructions were straightforward and everything was labeled accurately. The couch looks exactly like the photos, it is very aesthetic and chic. The price is great, you really can't complain much with this pricepoint. Biggest reason why I bought it was the look of it and the price point, as well as the fact that is doubles as a sleeper for guests. It is comfortable enough (if you're not going to be lounging for hours), and is on the firm side, which I like firm. This couch suits my needs. Overall, I was pinching pennies when buying this, and I am already looking forward to when I can afford a nicer, more cozy couch. However, it suits my needs for the time being and will get me by. Plus it's just so darn good looking in my living room. I am satisfied with the purchase. :) Read more 41 people found this helpful Helpful Report Ariel 5.0 out of 5 stars Most stylish and comfortable FUTON ever! Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024 Color: Black Style: Futon Verified Purchase Let me start by saying this: I hate futons. I have always thought they were ugly, cheap, and uncomfortable. That has been my experience with ever futon I’ve ever been on or owned. Except this time! I was not even going to consider a futon for my living space but my husband said something like “we could get something cheap like a futon but you’ll never do that…”. So I started looking at futons to prove a point. I came across this little gem and after serious consideration I ordered the black leather one. I was super excited to try this thing out. When it arrived I was immediately annoyed because they sent us the brown leather one instead of black. But I was between the black and brown ANYWAY so I said whatever and we put it together. (We did receive a partial credit back to our account for the inconvenience which is great). It didn’t take long to assemble at all. Once we placed it against the wall I was instantly happy with the look and kind of glad they sent the wrong color.. I sat down and omg it is actually comfortable! Nice feeling material, perfect size, comfy cushions and armrests. I am so pleasantly surprised! I can’t say how it will stand up to the test of time and use…but for the price and the credit received back for the mistake….I’m more than thrilled with this futon!

It was a great price and it looks so nice! It’s  a nice fabric easy to clean I have a cat and dog. It’s not that comfy I knew that though most futons aren’t. It is easy to put together just follow instructions. It’s easy to fold down I wouldn’t recommend for everyday unless you want to tighten the arms of the chair at least every week because the way I sit I lean on the arms. I am 5’6 and 175lbs and it fits me fine.

I love the back support and it’s very stylish. I love everything about it except the direction is horrible. There’s a small bar code you can upload and watch how to put it together on YouTube, how ever it just shows you how the person assembled the chair but with no caption wording on the instructions. I still had to figure out which screws to use. Thank God I’m visual enough to try to make it out. It took about an hour to put it together because of poor instructions. I would have given it a 5 star if the instructions were easy to understand.

Normally, my husband would assemble stuff like this. However, it came during a busy time, and I was able to build it myself even with two little running all around. The instructions are great, easy, and show you how to utilize the box to make building it easier. The color is beautiful and just as shown. It’s very comfortable, feels good quality, lightweight and easy enough to move upstairs by myself, and I don’t find myself having to constantly readjust. 100% recommend getting it if you’re interested at all!

Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase UPDATED REVIEW: Great customer service! Company reached out and sent free replacements parts immediately. Definitely above and beyond. 4 stars is because the chair is uncomfortable and oddly proportioned. This chair is not proportional, the arms are basically just decorations. Sat in for an hour (170 lbs) and one of the wheels broke off and won’t stay in. Can’t get apart to return, so now I have a useless chair and wasted money.

Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase This was so easy to assemble, I couldn't believe it! I do like it, a great value. I'm struggling with the tilt on the seat, it is not comfortable but I suspect that is operator error. Everything else is perfect. I'm very pleased with this purchase. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report Kalyn 3.0 out of 5 stars overall mediocre chair Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase the chair was a good price, which is originally why i purchased it. i had recently built a desk set up and was in the market for a budget chair, this was the first one to pop up. it arrived in good condition and was slightly difficult to set up as the screws didn’t want to line up properly and were almost stripping the plastic trying to attach them. the chair is lightly padded and not very comfortable. it is also not built for adult bodies despite being marketed for adults. myself, my average build dad, and my 15 year old brother did not fit comfortably in the chair. my small build 11 year old brother was able to fit better but also complained of back pain and butt pain within an hour. there is little to no lumbar support and overall the chair is quite painful. the chair rolls around fine and was quiet so no complaints there. overall, i am returning the chair for a different one. this would work if you need a cheap chair for a kid to sit in every so often but for long term use or adult use, it doesn’t hit the mark. as a side note, once i put in my return request, the seller messaged me back saying they could give me a 30% refund if i keep the chair despite me being adamant about returning it. just something to keep in mind when thinking about this seller and this product Read more 13 people found this helpful Helpful Report Lois W 5.0 out of 5 stars Great customer service! Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024 Color: Grey-fabric Verified Purchase The chair arrived on time. We had one minor issue with one of the wheels that did not fit correctly. I contacted Customer Service for the vendor, and after they had us confirm that the issue was with the wheel and not the base, they immediately sent out a replacement wheel. The new wheel fit perfectly. No other issues with the chair, which is comfortable, especially for the price range. Read more Helpful Report Miranda O'Haleck 5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable! Excellent customer service! Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase I love the mesh back chairs. They keep your back from getting sweaty and are comfortable.  We had an issue with the back of the chair we ordered. It loomed like the mesh came loose. Im not sure how or when. I started a refund, then canceled it. I just figured we would deal with it instead of having to ship the chair back, and the mesh netting wasn't loose enough to cause an issue at the time. The seller, Neo Chair, contacted us shortly after asking if we could send some photos of the issue with the chair. I sent the photos without the expectation of anything being done about it. The chair was roughly $30. It's hard to beat that. The seller asked if them sending us a replacement chair back would satisfy us. Wr told them that was perfect. They shipped the chair back and we received it a few days later. They were so quick to make things right. It was shocking to deal with customer service that was friendly, helpful and resolved the issue in such a short amount of time. I will be purchasing from them in the future as well. I would suggest anyone else do the same, of you want a quality chair as well as piece of mind if something does happen.

For Mid-Century Modern décor enthusiasts, the Novogratz Brittany Futon is a game-changing multifunctional furniture piece that will set your living room, home office, or guest room apart from the rest.

Uniquely designed with ribbed channel tufting on the backrest, curved armrests, and 4 slanted solid wood legs that are felt-lined for floor protection, the Brittany's foam cushioned seat and padded arms provide a firm foundation for rest, as do its small-space plywood frame build with supportive no-sag spring backing, 2 plastic center legs, and 2 concealed fold-out support legs located within rear zippered pockets. Offered in multiple colors, the Brittany is available in both easy-to-clean linen look and faux leather upholstery options.

I’m using it in an office just for some seating if I want to relax. It’s pretty sturdy but the texture of the fabric is not the most soft. The size is great for me. I fit just right and I’m a 5’10 male. Any taller then you wouldn’t be able to fully stretch out. It was easy to put together. Although the smell of the couch is bad like chemicals. I’m sure it will go away over time. All in all I do recommend this couch because for its looks, price, and function as a futon. So if this is your budget then go for it but if you have a bigger budget, you might wanna find something that’s more comfortable.

Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024 Color: Blue Style: Futon Verified Purchase I was blown away by the quality of this sofa for the price. When I purchased mine, there was a promotion so I actually paid less than $200 for this model. It arrived in a single compact box which had me worried at first, but when I unpacked this sofa I was pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the material. (The engineering behind the packing and couch design deserve recognition, it’s the most efficient thing I’ve seen in a long time) In a nutshell, I am completely satisfied with this futon. The material is soft and durable, the sofa is comfortable to sit on after long periods of time, and it’s designed to turn into a bed! The style and aesthetic perfectly matches our home, and it was incredibly easy to assemble. It took me less than 30 minutes to assemble by myself, and it seats 3 people comfortably. I hope this blue color becomes available again soon! I could really use another one. Read more Lucky 🍀 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Sofa for the price… plus it’s a futon bed!

Images in this review 7 people found this helpful Helpful Report Hannah 4.0 out of 5 stars Stylish - Not The Most Comfortable Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023 Color: Camel Faux Leather Style: Futon Verified Purchase I got this couch last month, and to preface my review, I will say that I needed this piece for furnishing my first apartment and I am confined to a VERY tight budget. So I was looking for the cheapest couch possible that still looked nice. Overall I am satisfied with my first ever couch, but excited for the day when I can afford a nice, high quality, real leather, and comfortable couch, and give this one to someone in need. So if you can afford to get a better couch than this one, I would recommend to just bite the bullet and invest in a better couch. You will regret your purchase if you had more money to spend on a couch and got this one instead. I simply couldn't afford a nicer couch. First, I'll start off with the cons: If you are looking for a comfortable couch and that is your #1 priority in buying a couch, this is not the couch for you. Just pay more for comfort. Seriously. It will be worth it for you. If you are looking for a quality couch that will last a long time, this is not the couch for you. For example, the arms are held in place by 3 bolts at the bottom, and so when people lean their bodyweight on the arm (most people I know sit this way), you can tell its not meant to support that type of lounging because it moves and creaks a little lol. My sister slept over on the couch and she said that she would have been more comfortable if I had a sleeping pad, so I'll have to invest in one of those for my guests. Keep in mind, she's a side sleeper and this is a firm couch. Might be better if you sleep on your back, but still, the couch is not as padded as I thought it would be. I was expecting the padding to be firm because that's what I saw from reviews, but it doesn’t seem as substantial as I'd hoped. I thought the foam was going to be more dense? Idk how else to describe it, but that is something that surprised me a little was how "hollow" the seats feel. Like eventually with more wear I'll just fall through. Even with how cheap it is, I wasn't expecting the seats to feel like that. Oh well. To end my review on a positive note... Pros: This couch was easy to assemble, I am pregnant and was able to do it all by myself easily within an hour or 2. The instructions were straightforward and everything was labeled accurately. The couch looks exactly like the photos, it is very aesthetic and chic. The price is great, you really can't complain much with this pricepoint. Biggest reason why I bought it was the look of it and the price point, as well as the fact that is doubles as a sleeper for guests. It is comfortable enough (if you're not going to be lounging for hours), and is on the firm side, which I like firm. This couch suits my needs. Overall, I was pinching pennies when buying this, and I am already looking forward to when I can afford a nicer, more cozy couch. However, it suits my needs for the time being and will get me by. Plus it's just so darn good looking in my living room. I am satisfied with the purchase. :) Read more 41 people found this helpful Helpful Report Ariel 5.0 out of 5 stars Most stylish and comfortable FUTON ever! Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024 Color: Black Style: Futon Verified Purchase Let me start by saying this: I hate futons. I have always thought they were ugly, cheap, and uncomfortable. That has been my experience with ever futon I’ve ever been on or owned. Except this time! I was not even going to consider a futon for my living space but my husband said something like “we could get something cheap like a futon but you’ll never do that…”. So I started looking at futons to prove a point. I came across this little gem and after serious consideration I ordered the black leather one. I was super excited to try this thing out. When it arrived I was immediately annoyed because they sent us the brown leather one instead of black. But I was between the black and brown ANYWAY so I said whatever and we put it together. (We did receive a partial credit back to our account for the inconvenience which is great). It didn’t take long to assemble at all. Once we placed it against the wall I was instantly happy with the look and kind of glad they sent the wrong color.. I sat down and omg it is actually comfortable! Nice feeling material, perfect size, comfy cushions and armrests. I am so pleasantly surprised! I can’t say how it will stand up to the test of time and use…but for the price and the credit received back for the mistake….I’m more than thrilled with this futon!

It was a great price and it looks so nice! It’s  a nice fabric easy to clean I have a cat and dog. It’s not that comfy I knew that though most futons aren’t. It is easy to put together just follow instructions. It’s easy to fold down I wouldn’t recommend for everyday unless you want to tighten the arms of the chair at least every week because the way I sit I lean on the arms. I am 5’6 and 175lbs and it fits me fine.

I had been eyeballing these beds for a while. The shipping cost is what kept me from getting them earlier. But with the cost of the beds being so cheap the shipping combined still made the beds a reasonable price. They are 100% worth the cost plus shipping. All the pieces were labeled nicely. Nothing about this bed is cheaply made. After adding the mattress it is a solid, no squeaking bed! It took approx 30-45 mins for 1 person to put together 1 bed. I 10/10 recommend!

Teesha 5.0 out of 5 stars Great quality for the price Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024 Color: Bronze Size: King Verified Purchase bed frame came all together at the same time,  simple instructions, real easy to put together. It’s very aesthetically pleasing as well as useful. Not noisy at all and feels sturdy. Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Report LAGirlFarmer 5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing bed for the cost Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024 Color: Black Size: Full Verified Purchase where do I even begin?  I was quite skeptical of ordering this bed in the beginning, even though I love the way that it looked online.  The box did arrive damaged however none of the parts were missing and none of the product was damaged.  It did take a little bit of time even with two people to construct the bed however, it is very well made, Seems to be very sturdy, Does not wiggle wobble or squeak and is made of metal tubing.  I love the fact that it did not require a boxspring for the mattress and that it still seems to support the mattress very well.  We bought this for a full size bed and it fit wonderfully while still not being hard to make up the bed.  I would say overall, the stability and performance of the bed will truly show overtime but for now we are quite pleased.  One thing that I do like is that it is not too high or too low and because of that it is comfortable to get off and on.  The bed is made of metal pipe so it does require some time to put together, but it did not feel like the old thin, brass bed metal tubing.  I am honestly considering ordering another one because I feel that it is very stable and would look great in a guest bedroom.

LaClave 4.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024 Color: White Size: Full Verified Purchase Looks pretty nice when put together and feels very sturdy.  Assembly wasn’t bad at all.  I like that a box spring wasn’t needed because of the metal support bars.  I don’t like that it cost an extra $40 to ship considering I’ve purchased heavier items on Amazon that had actual free shipping.  Also be aware that the screws, bolts, and washers that you assemble the bed with are a chrome silver. The bed color we chose was white and I think the hardware being silver makes it stand out in  a way that makes it look cheap. Granted this is value priced furniture but I’d rather it not look that way.  We are going to paint ours white to blend in with the frame.  Otherwise satisfied with this purchase.

Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024 Color: Black Size: King Verified Purchase I’m so glad this was the first piece of furniture I bought during my renovation process! I was in desperate need for a new bed frame and was going to wait until after I fixed the walls and painted, but I caved and bought this. It is sturdy, easy to assemble, and comfortable! It’s tall enough to have some storage underneath if needed, but not too tall that it’s hard to get in and out of. It does not squeak at all, if you catch my drift, and putting it together was a breeze. It’s light weight and cute! I’m able to build my vision for my bedroom around this bed frame because it’s simple, but effective in looks! I 100% recommend! Read more Christina 5.0 out of 5 stars Sturdy!

I am really impressed with the quality of this little end table! It is sturdy and has leveling feet. If you read the instructions carefully, and pay attention to the orientation of each of the pieces while putting it together, you’ll do very well with it. They have taken the time to label everything very carefully, and so it is easy to understand which piece goes where. They have even included a hex key and a small screwdriver in case you don’t already have one. You won’t need any extra tools to do this. They also included a couple of extra screws in case you lose one. I really like the look of the end table and it was definitely worth the money.

My husband and I accomplished the task in 15 or 20 minutes. It's designed well and pretty much stupid proof as the parts don't have to be in specific positions. The electrical outlet is very sturdy and easy to install. I like the storage and wider tabletop. I am using it next to my chair to hold books and charge phones, ect. It is made of fiberboard but for the price it looks decent and fits my needs.

This is Chinese particle board. It's not real wood. The leg material is metal but thin. My guess is thin gauge steel of some sort. It is coated with black paint. This unit was smaller than I had expected which could be a Pro depending on what you are looking for. If you want an end table for a low chair or couch it will be sufficient. It would fit very well in a small apartment to add outlets, USB, and efficient storage space. Finally, the assembly was straightforward part from the final two shelves. I'd recommend having a small box or an assistant to hold the shelves as they are screwed in place. For one person this part can be awkward and fatiguing if you have poor upper body strength. Now on to the good. For such a small end table it is surprisingly sturdy. Included are some screw-in adjustable end caps for the legs which make this much nicer for wood, or tile floors. The instructions are in total about 10 steps. I mentioned in the cons it is made of Chinese particle board which is true however I was also surprised by the finish on the parts. usually, there are blown-out corners or rough router marks but this was finished fairly well. I hate that my expectations are so low that I was surprised by that but the finish on this particular piece was quite nice. They even added a miter cut for the drawer bottom so the electronics cable could be routed without additional fitting. The until came with all the necessary parts but more importantly, it also was exactly like the picture. Again, I hate that in today's world I have to write that but it is true. The outlets sit where they are shown in the picture, the size is estimated as close as possible, and overall if your expectations are correct for an $80 end table then you will not be disappointed. The last thing that I'll mention about the pros is that all tools are included. The only two tools I needed were a knife for opening packaging and at the end one of the foot didn't want to screw in so I had to use a pair of pliers to get it past a manufacturing defect in the tapping. Beyond that, you only need the included Allen wrench and a Phillips screwdriver. The one included is a nice size too. IT was study and fit the small screws exactly. There were only 8 screws so this was a bonus for anyone not in possession of a Phillips screwdriver. You might keep it for a while to use around the house. Overall I gave this 5 stars. I only took one star away from sturdiness as I have no idea how sturdy it will stay in the future. The long Allen head screws seem to be well placed in the particle wood. The question will be the wood as the screws seem well suited for the job. If the wood holds up then this would be 5 out of 5 for sturdy again with the understanding this is a light-duty end table made of particle board. It's a step up from Ikea but not by much. I wouldn't sit on it but you'll be ok to put a lamp, computer, coffee, and a small house plant. If the cat jumps up with all that it may become sketchy. At this time I'd recommend the product. It is doing the job I bought it for and I'm overall happy with the fit and construction for the price. If the quality were to be less then I'd price this much lower. Since there was some attention to detail I'd say it's priced about right. Anywhere between $50-80 would be correct and a good buy. Read more 50 people found this helpful Helpful Report Brian D. Maconaughey 4.0 out of 5 stars Simple assembly, good for the price. Needs updated with usb-c. Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024 Color: Cherry Size: Pack of 1 Verified Purchase The "wood" parts are particle board with a woodgrain plastic overlay, but that's to be expected at this price point. The metal parts and hardware are decently made and the whole table feels quite sturdy once assembled. It isn't fancy furniture but it's worth what you pay. The power panel provides 2 AC outlets and 2 usb-a charging ports. Should include usb-c. Read more Helpful Report Amazon Customer 5.0 out of 5 stars Great side table, but the instructions could use some help Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024 Color: Brown Size: Pack of 1 Verified Purchase I recently purchased the LIDYUK End Table with Charging Station, intrigued by its innovative design featuring a flip top and built-in USB ports and outlets. While the table itself is functional and stylish, there's one notable downside that hindered my overall experience: the instructions. The design of the LIDYUK End Table is sleek and modern, making it a stylish addition to any living room or bedroom. The flip top feature is a convenient addition, providing extra storage space for books, remotes, or other small items. The built-in USB ports and outlets offer added functionality, allowing for easy charging of devices without the need for additional adapters. Unfortunately, the assembly process was marred by the lackluster instructions provided with the table. The diagrams were unclear, and the written instructions were vague at best. Assembling the table became a frustrating and time-consuming task, requiring trial and error to decipher the correct steps. While I eventually managed to assemble the table, the poor instructions significantly detracted from the overall user experience. Once assembled, the LIDYUK End Table feels sturdy and well-made. The materials used are of decent quality, and the table appears to be durable enough to withstand regular use. The flip top mechanism operates smoothly, and the USB ports and outlets function as expected, providing reliable charging capabilities. The LIDYUK End Table with Charging Station offers a blend of style and functionality with its innovative design and built-in charging capabilities. However, the assembly process was hindered by the inadequate instructions provided with the table. If you're willing to overlook this flaw and appreciate the table's features, it may still be worth considering. Just be prepared for a potentially frustrating assembly experience.

And I totally missed that one side of it flips up (this is not a problem, it just surprised me.  It gives easy access to storage, which is great). I *would* like to have seen some cable management added, since the cable is pretty long, but I can add that. In any case, we're thinking pretty strongly about getting more.  The power outlet is a huge selling point.

Has a shelf, and a "hinged" hidden compartment (I usd it for a variety of remotes) The height and width are exactly what I needed (it sits next to my bed- at the required height). Quite nice for a reasonable amount. Assembly was easy- but before putting it together, consider where you want the power cable to come out from (which side). The way you place a shelf will determine this. Oh, did I mention it comed with two outlets and two USB connections!! Very cool. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report Suzanne M. Brouillet 5.0 out of 5 stars True to size and color Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024 Color: Greige Size: Pack of 2 Verified Purchase We were looking for tables to fit in a small space on each side of our couch.  These tables fit perfectly and the color is as indicated. Assembly was easy, it did help to have two sets of hands. I cannot yet speak to how long they will hold up but so far we are liking them.

Liza 5.0 out of 5 stars Smaller than it seems Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024 Color: Black/Grey Size: Round Corner Verified Purchase It's very stable even though it has a low carrying capacity. It's the right height for me (personally I didn't want anything about 30 or so inches) but width wise it isn't so wide. It was extremely easy to assemble, it took me about 15 minutes, and it doesn't require any screws or tools, just your hands and the items involved. I've had my Tv, console and few other items and it's managed to hold them up without any issue. I think it would be a little better with bigger or stronger individual shelves, as the ones that come with it are very small. But overall, it's very nice and worth the price, if you need something quick and easy to assemble. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report Mia 5.0 out of 5 stars The best!

It is perfect for the spot I had for it: in front of the fireplace I never use. I love the rounded sides, and it is sturdy enough for my 16 pound tv. While the legs are plastic, they look much better than I thought they would. The Columbia Walnut wood color is attractive, and just what I wanted. I like the rounded ends, though I am not sure I would buy this tv stand were my tv larger than 43 inches. Not bad for $37.

This item is just the right length - not too wide and not too snug.  The stand itself (a bit of a push to call it a 'TV Entertainment Centre') is not in heritage furniture territory but does the job at a very modest price.  The instructions are well written and illustrated and it took me 15 minutes to unpack and put together.  There is nothing heavy about it that requires two person installation and no tools are required.  The supporting pieces for the tiers are made of heavy duty plastic and just screw together.  It's really well thought out.  The unit looks the part and I'm more than happy with it.

This shelf was perfect for my sons room and had a lot of storage for all of his collectibles and Legos. I also like how the baskets on the bottom hide any miscellaneous items that you don't want displayed, such as cords and chargers. It is so sturdy that we decided not to anchor it to the wall. I am very pleased with this purchase and would buy again.

TinyCustomer 5.0 out of 5 stars Aesthetically Pleasing and Affordable Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024 Color: Rustic Brown Size: 6 Tier Verified Purchase We originally bought this to go in a closet as an organizer but it was so nice we pulled it into our main office. The shelves were easy to assemble and can hold quite a bit of weight. We have really heavy books on them now and they're doing just fine. The drawers are cloth with a wood finish print. They don't feel flimsy and can be placed on any shelf. I would say that the structure shakes a little but that could just be because of our uneven flooring. Anchoring it to the wall made it more stable. If you are looking for something affordable that looks nice at a glance, this is it. Read more Helpful Report Pete 5.0 out of 5 stars Very good quality and good value Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024 Color: Rustic Brown Size: 6 Tier Verified Purchase This shelving unit has very good quality components, and looks nice when assembled. Assembly takes some time as there are quite a few parts (surly to keep the shipping size down) but everything fit perfectly and the pictorial assembly instructions were easy to follow. The 2 drawers are the fabric collapsable type with a solid front and bottom; all you do is fold them open, put the bottom in,  and add the handles on the front. They are very simple, light, and they look nice. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report Bestlife 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for a small place.

Read more Helpful Report Amazon Customer 4.0 out of 5 stars Decent, but lots of parts means a long assembly time. Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024 Color: Black Oak Size: 6 Tier Verified Purchase This is a decent bookcase once finished, but it has a LOT of parts.  Even with a cordless screwdriver it took about an hour to assemble - I can't imagine building this with the tiny wrench that was included.  The instructions were very clear, and all of the parts were marked well.  The kit was also packaged very nicely, with strong gussets placed around the panels to prevent shipping damage.  I was impressed with the packing.  The drawers are actually fabric, origami-style, open-top cubes, which is fine, just not what I was expecting.  The finished product looks nice, and the finish on the shelves is also nice.

Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024 Color: Rustic Brown Size: 5 Tier Verified Purchase Love the shelves. Husband said easy to assemble. Drawers can be placed on any of the shelves. Perfect size for my small room. Love the color and stability! Read more Helpful Report Meredith L 5.0 out of 5 stars Very cute and easy enough to install! Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2023 Color: Rustic Brown Size: 6 Tier Verified Purchase I bought 2 of these to spice up my office. Very cute, but sometimes they make me nervous with how they move when I take out a basket. They always hold up, but they sway a bit. So if you are planning on storing weights (I don't know why you would) or super heavy things in this, I'd recommend to get a different one or find a different storage space. However, the storage bins are cloth but appear as wood from a distance. I was shocked by this because I didn't except that, but I don't mind it now. Just know, they are cloth baskets, not wood. BUT they store A LOT. I put SOOO much stuff in them and they hold it well. Back to the swaying of the shelf, I have all of my books from when I went to my university, plus a bunch of other stuff in the other basket. It holds up well, the bit of swaying it does just makes me a little nervous lol. But it hasn't ever fallen over or caused an issue. So it can handle weight, I'd just be careful. It makes it easy to store things and you can put the cloth baskets anywhere on the shelf! Overall, super super cute. About an hour to set up or so. My husband and I got a little frustrated trying to figure it out BUT there were detailed instructions and stickers on all the pieces so it was probably just human error haha. I absolutely adore my shelves and couldn't be happier!

Great quality with the option of shelf pattern being more traditional on one side to a slightly rougher stain on the other (my choice!! )  Easy to follow instructions 1,2,3,4,5, -- just be sure to sort out alphabetical pairs together BEFORE starting assembly. The alan wrench is not cut perfectly so have a spare handy just in case yours wears out like mine did 2/3 way through (probably a bit heavy handed) Check the measurements as the image is an optical illusion. I DID, and knew exactly what I as getting but others may purchase simply by looks. A perfect size for my front hallway and it looks very "classy"  Most happy to highly recommend purchase for price, quality and ease of assembly. Read more DEBORAH 5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble 100% quality goods - Adjustable 2pcs storage boxes Reviewed in Canada on December 2, 2022 Order arrived 2 weeks ahead of schedule with ALL bits and bobs included with x1 extra screw per needs. Great quality with the option of shelf pattern being more traditional on one side to a slightly rougher stain on the other (my choice!! )  Easy to follow instructions 1,2,3,4,5, -- just be sure to sort out alphabetical pairs together BEFORE starting assembly. The alan wrench is not cut perfectly so have a spare handy just in case yours wears out like mine did 2/3 way through (probably a bit heavy handed) Check the measurements as the image is an optical illusion.

James 5.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful and easy to follow instructions Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2024 Verified Purchase This arrives in a VERY HEAVY box, so try to get it delivered/dropped where you will be assembling.  Excellent packaging, by the way. I am a 61 year old woman, and was able to put this together in approximately 5 hours, by just taking my time.  The instructions are the best I’ve ever seen.  It is heavy once assembly moves along, so I do recommend 2 people.  (My husband was out doing his flying job, and I didn’t want to wait). But I was able to handle it. The hardware is brass, so I spray painted all of it bronze since that is our preferred finish in the room. Very pleased with this purchase! Read more Jean E.

The actual box is quite heavy, so definitely a two-person lift. I unloaded it with the help of the UPS driver. The assembly is long: about four hours, if you want to do it right. I mean performing an inventory on the parts and hardware and laying out the pieces in order. One also needs a large carpeted area to lay out the individual parts for ease of assembly. I did not need a helper. It says not to use power tools, but I used an impact driver on the lightest torque setting to avoid carpal tunnel installing the hundreds of fasteners (no kidding - hundreds). The end product is sturdy enough and looks quite nice. I gave it 5 stars, because it is exactly as described. Read more 5 people found this helpful Helpful Report B. Mardini 3.0 out of 5 stars Professional Assembly Required Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2022 Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded. I purchased the unit with full assembly service, thus it was delivered & Assembled by Amazon. It took two staff from Amazon 2 hours to install. There is no way I would have been able to install it myself without any help, unless you are a handyman or woman with proper tools. Amazon staff installed the dresser per instruction manual using the pre drilled holes; however, the cabinet doors were not properly aligned with large gaps on 2 sides & “0” gaps on the other 2 sides. Furthermore, the cabinet doors do not close flush with the cabinet as they projects 4mm from the cabinet surface. The drawers do not open all the way & get stuck at 1/2 point of opening, then you have to forcefully open it all the way. I also noticed one area requiring touch up to cover minor scratch As it stands, the dresser is not acceptable visually & operationally; I will approach Amazon to resolve these issues , otherwise they need to pick it up & take it away. June 2022, I contacted Amazon & discussed the defects above, they offered a 20% discount that I used to cover the repairs by local carpenter to fix the issues. Now the  buffet cabinet looks great & my wife is happy as she loves the style 😊👍 Read more 26 people found this helpful Helpful Report K. Garcia 5.0 out of 5 stars Gorgeous piece of furniture Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021 Verified Purchase Gorgeous, sturdy and a great value for comparable pieces of furniture. My husband also frequently commented on how well written the instructions to assemble were. Makes me smile every time I pass by it. The ONLY THING is that one door is slightly too far left that it leaves an slightly larger gap than it’s supposed to have. Literally 1 or 2 cm off. If my husband hadn’t mentioned it, I wouldn’t have noticed but …he did …so now I know….

High enough off the ground for a robot vacuum to get underneath. Cabinet’s are tall enough and deep enough to put wine bottles either standing up or on their sides facing out. I purchased this mostly to use as a bar cabinet, and it fits everything nicely. The box that it arrives in was well packaged to protect the pieces inside, but heavy and needs two to lift and move inside if delivery is left outside. Assembly says it recommends two people but I was able to assemble it alone, two people may have made it easier and take less time but very doable still with one. Overall very happy with my purchase and would recommend it. The doors are a little tricky to get aligned perfectly, and I read some other complaints about it in the reviews before purchasing. There are adjustment screws in the hinges that can be manipulated to get the doors better aligned. Instructions on how this works are not included but trial and error worked out in the end.

I love the back support and it’s very stylish. I love everything about it except the direction is horrible. There’s a small bar code you can upload and watch how to put it together on YouTube, how ever it just shows you how the person assembled the chair but with no caption wording on the instructions. I still had to figure out which screws to use. Thank God I’m visual enough to try to make it out. It took about an hour to put it together because of poor instructions. I would have given it a 5 star if the instructions were easy to understand.

Normally, my husband would assemble stuff like this. However, it came during a busy time, and I was able to build it myself even with two little running all around. The instructions are great, easy, and show you how to utilize the box to make building it easier. The color is beautiful and just as shown. It’s very comfortable, feels good quality, lightweight and easy enough to move upstairs by myself, and I don’t find myself having to constantly readjust. 100% recommend getting it if you’re interested at all! We aren’t disappointed! Read more 13 people found this helpful Helpful Report BobR52 5.0 out of 5 stars What can you say about an incredible price... Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase I needed a new office chair to go with my new MacBook so I started looking around and found this chair -- wow -- what a price -- under $50 -- for a very comfortable and fully functional office chair.

Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase UPDATED REVIEW: Great customer service! Company reached out and sent free replacements parts immediately. Definitely above and beyond. 4 stars is because the chair is uncomfortable and oddly proportioned. This chair is not proportional, the arms are basically just decorations. Sat in for an hour (170 lbs) and one of the wheels broke off and won’t stay in. Can’t get apart to return, so now I have a useless chair and wasted money.

Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase This was so easy to assemble, I couldn't believe it! I do like it, a great value. I'm struggling with the tilt on the seat, it is not comfortable but I suspect that is operator error. Everything else is perfect. I'm very pleased with this purchase. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report Kalyn 3.0 out of 5 stars overall mediocre chair Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase the chair was a good price, which is originally why i purchased it. i had recently built a desk set up and was in the market for a budget chair, this was the first one to pop up. it arrived in good condition and was slightly difficult to set up as the screws didn’t want to line up properly and were almost stripping the plastic trying to attach them. the chair is lightly padded and not very comfortable. it is also not built for adult bodies despite being marketed for adults. myself, my average build dad, and my 15 year old brother did not fit comfortably in the chair. my small build 11 year old brother was able to fit better but also complained of back pain and butt pain within an hour. there is little to no lumbar support and overall the chair is quite painful. the chair rolls around fine and was quiet so no complaints there. overall, i am returning the chair for a different one. this would work if you need a cheap chair for a kid to sit in every so often but for long term use or adult use, it doesn’t hit the mark. as a side note, once i put in my return request, the seller messaged me back saying they could give me a 30% refund if i keep the chair despite me being adamant about returning it. just something to keep in mind when thinking about this seller and this product Read more 13 people found this helpful Helpful Report Lois W 5.0 out of 5 stars Great customer service! Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024 Color: Grey-fabric Verified Purchase The chair arrived on time. We had one minor issue with one of the wheels that did not fit correctly. I contacted Customer Service for the vendor, and after they had us confirm that the issue was with the wheel and not the base, they immediately sent out a replacement wheel. The new wheel fit perfectly. No other issues with the chair, which is comfortable, especially for the price range. Read more Helpful Report Miranda O'Haleck 5.0 out of 5 stars Very comfortable! Excellent customer service! Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase I love the mesh back chairs. They keep your back from getting sweaty and are comfortable.  We had an issue with the back of the chair we ordered. It loomed like the mesh came loose. Im not sure how or when. I started a refund, then canceled it. I just figured we would deal with it instead of having to ship the chair back, and the mesh netting wasn't loose enough to cause an issue at the time. The seller, Neo Chair, contacted us shortly after asking if we could send some photos of the issue with the chair. I sent the photos without the expectation of anything being done about it. The chair was roughly $30. It's hard to beat that. The seller asked if them sending us a replacement chair back would satisfy us. Wr told them that was perfect. They shipped the chair back and we received it a few days later. They were so quick to make things right. It was shocking to deal with customer service that was friendly, helpful and resolved the issue in such a short amount of time. I will be purchasing from them in the future as well. I would suggest anyone else do the same, of you want a quality chair as well as piece of mind if something does happen.

Product Description Bring a finishing touch to your home with an inviting appeal with this beautifully crafted accent table. A compact friendly table providing you with additional surface storage space any where in your home. As a versatile piece, the brown end table can be placed next to your sofa or used as a display stand for rustic decor like an organic vase with pampas grass. This item ships in 1 carton. The one-of-a-kind item you have purchased is made from the stumps and unused trunks of harvested teak trees. This teak comes from ecologically managed forests. Once the tree is harvested, the remaining stumps must be removed to make space to plant replacement trees. In the past, these pieces would be harvested and then burned to dispose of them, which created pollution. Today we use these tree stumps and trunks to create beautiful, handcrafted pieces for your home. Coloring, cracks, and shapes will vary between items. Each one is unique and the artisan works to bring out the inner beauty within the tree to become a cherished piece of art for your home. Suitable for indoor use only. This item ships fully assembled in one piece. Due to the live edges of the piece, each is unique, so no two products will have an identical pattern, shade, or cut. Maximum weight limit is 100 lbs. Made in Indonesia. This is a single brown colored end table. Contemporary style.

Jessica 5.0 out of 5 stars Looks great Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024 Color: Walnut Style: Barn Doors TV Stand Verified Purchase This TV stand requires two people to assemble it, but I did it on my own. I like how it complements the rest of my wood furniture. The instructional booklet was simple to follow. I was worried it was going to be unsteady, but with all of the pieces put together, it turned out solid. All the pieces are labeled with numbers, which are easy to remove with scraper and some goo gone. Obviously, it’s not completely made of wood, so being extra careful in placing and drilling the screws will prevent cracking. I did make a few mistakes as I assembled it alone, but they’re all inside the frame, therefore out of view. I’m very happy with the product.

Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024 Color: Gray Wash Style: Barn Doors TV Stand Verified Purchase I really love the product. At first when I was putting the stand together it seems flimsy but once it’s all put together it’s very sturdy. The only thing that didn’t stay in place was the little pieces the hold the shelves in the cabinet they kept falling out but I hot glued it so it worked fine.

At first when I was putting the stand together it seems flimsy but once it’s all put together it’s very sturdy. The only thing that didn’t stay in place was the little pieces the hold the shelves in the cabinet they kept falling out but I hot glued it so it worked fine. It took a little over 2 hours to put together with two people. Only because the instructions are only pictures there’s no word telling what to do lol but it was still helpful.. if your looking for something affordable and nice get it!

It was pretty simple to put together. Some of the pieces came damaged and after putting it together it was not worth returning it due to small damages. I wish the pieces would have came in better shape.

Images in this review 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report John 3.0 out of 5 stars Carpenter Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024 Verified Purchase It looks nice once assembled instructions are pretty much useless. They just show pictures and you have to guess how to put it together. The instructions are not detailed at all. They do not give you any extra parts. Where is the screw? You used to pull in the pins, if you overtighten them at all by hand, they break again they give you nothing extra instructions vague overall looks good but we’re not purchase again. It’s all particleboard.

It was fairly simple to put together and very sturdy. You will need a drill at one point because there were screws for one of the steps but no pre made holes. Great buy for the price.

You can’t beat the price for just a corner small table and the quality is surprisingly good too. There were no scratches or cracks which is what I was worried about for the low price but there wasn’t. If I need another color I will definitely be getting a second one.

Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024 Color: Green Verified Purchase Some people may think it’s crazy to spend around $100 for a “dog bed,” but this is exactly who I bought it for…my 13 pound, 12 yr old dog. I found this small couch that’s lower to the ground than an average loveseat, and fits in my bedroom perfectly. Regular loveseats are typically too big, even for smaller spaces. My 12 year old dog can get up and down off of it easily and he loves it! It looks great and it’s up off the floor, which is what I really wanted for him. I think it’s hilarious that some have complained that it’s more a child size couch, and not for an adult… All you have to do is look at the measurements, (which is what everyone should do before ordering). I wanted to make sure it fit in the spot I wanted to put it in! It’s not meant for full grown adults to hang out on… It’s cute, I didn’t even need to look at the directions to put it together, and the quality is very nice. Looks better in my room than another typical dog bed! Recommend! Read more Stacey Dexter 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect as a dog bed!!

It is attractive.  It does fit in small areas.  It is fairly comfortable and it is easy to assemble.  What is not is well made.  The bolts attaching the legs do not remain tight.  The back just slips on and it loosens up over time.  The whole thing seems shoddy.  To make matters worse; it is now on sale for half of what I paid for it.  At least now the price is set closer to what it is worth.

Soloman 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Styling Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024 Color: Seeded Clear Verified Purchase This pair of lamps is a great value. They are quality styled and the charging port is a bonus! I also appreciate the lighting option control because I have them on bedside tables. Therefore, I can have dim lighting when my partner prefers brighter lighting.

Easy to assemble and the lighting/dimming is adjustable. The knob on top is used to control the brightness of the light. The lamp has a plug on top and USB charging ports on the side to easily charge phones or other electronics.  They are thin and medium height. They are not bulky.

I like the on/ off switch, which is also the dimmer. The weighted base keeps it stable. I almost always use it on the dimmest setting because its plenty bright for bedside use. The charging ports are a really cool feature Read more Helpful Report Amazon Customer 4.0 out of 5 stars Easy peasy and a nice look Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024 Color: Seeded Clear Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded.

Images in this review 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report Marian 5.0 out of 5 stars Attractive, useful lamps Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024 Color: Seeded Clear Verified Purchase We're using these attractive lamps as our bedside table lamps. They work extremely well in that capacity. Each lamp has a fairly heavy base, so it won't  fall over or slide around on a table (a problem we had with a previous small lamp). The dimmer switch (which also turns on the lamp) goes from very low light to VERY bright, making the lamp useful for anything from just ambience to whatever you need bright light for. (However, these ARE LED bulbs, so their "yellow" light isn't really yellow. I dislike the whitish light so I'm replacing the bulbs.) The electrical outlet on the top of the base is a plus, and also very useful, as are the USB ports for phone or Kindle or other device charging. These lamps are available in a handful of metal colors and shade colors/textures. They are also inexpensive These are better than I was expecting. I'm very happy with them.

They definitely work well to hold what I need and seem sturdy enough, and were fairly easy to assemble. However, one of them had some misalignment issues. No matter how hard I tried on it, I could not get the back paneling to line up - it just was not square. Also, a couple of the shelves didn't align either. None of it was bad enough to attempt a return - they were cheap and I didn't expect perfection. I've owned many of these particleboard type pieces of furniture and they were a expected. I move every 2-3 years and don't expect to keep them much longer than that, which is why I buy cheap!They're definitely decent, look good, but probably won't make it through my next move intact.

David Bantz 5.0 out of 5 stars good small light-duty bookcase easy to assemble Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024 Color: Steam Beech Size: 3-Tier Verified Purchase Simple, light-weight shelves, easily assembled. Extra kudos for the simple small but effective nail holder that keeps the nail upright, away from your fingers, and positioned exactly right distance from the edge (you nail the very thin back onto the shelves). In the photo of two, I added simple vertical support to avoid what would otherwise be sagging shelves (they are just friction fit). To be clear, these are not fine furniture - just vinyl over thin particle board, but good value for what they are.

They were very affordable, and the color is nice. Additionally, they were easy to put together for the most part. That being said, they do seem a bit flimsy--the instruction manual itself says that each shelf can only hold 15lbs--so I would not want to use this for books or anything heavy. Additionally, as can be expected at this price, they're particle board, and several of the pieces don't line up particularly well. Also, one of the bottom pieces (labeled B) didn't have the holes marking where to attach the part that goes along the ground in the front (part C), and in the other package, one of the little plastic feet didn't have a nail in it. Overall, for the price and what I got them for, these are fine. I wouldn't put them in a living room or somewhere like that, nor would I put anything heavy (like books) on them, but for a home office, bedroom, or game room, these could be a decent option. Read more 15 people found this helpful Helpful Report Deborah W 4.0 out of 5 stars Good enough! Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024 Color: Plain White Size: 3-Tier Verified Purchase I ordered these bookshelves with specific measurements in mind. In that regard they are perfect, fitting into the space just as i expected, so I give it 5 stars there. They were easy enough to assemble, but since the shelves are not adjustable, but attached to the sides, assembly took a bit longer than some other shelves I have assembled. Since I did not have any issues with understanding how to assemble and I received all the necessary parts , I give the assembly process 5 stars as well. The shelves are sturdy enough for my purposes, but if you want to pack it full of heavy books, they may not hold up well in the long term. I recommend taking into account the weight limits given in the description. Based on the description, and my experience so far, I give it 5 stars there, too. Where I took a star off my overall review is with the sturdiness of the very top of the bookcase. My husband was looking fir a specific book and when he stood up he steadied himself with the corner of the top shelf. It did not completely damage it, but I did need to glue a couple blocks of wood to reinforce the connection where the shelf is attached to the sides. For extra measure, I did the same with the inside shelves as well. If they would include some type of reinforcement fir added sturdiness, this would have elevated my overall review to 5 stars. All in all, I do recommend these shelves, and would purchase again.

It is cheaper and thinner materials so be aware of the books you're putting on it. One thing to note is you can see the seam of the backing (2nd photo). Which is fine since it's filled with books but you may want to wallpaper the backing if you're not going to fill the bookcase.

Images in this review 8 people found this helpful Helpful Report JenniofJABB 3.0 out of 5 stars One was really beautiful and easy to assemble.  The other had some major issues. Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024 Color: French Oak Grey Size: 4-Tier Verified Purchase I really love the French Gray Oak shade of this bookcase and chose it specifically for that reason and it didn't disappoint!  I believe the directions said two people were best for assembly but I did it myself using my couch to prop up pieces.  If I could improve anything, though, it would be to have adjustable shelves.  As is, the shelves are too short for many of my books.  Still, it's a really nice piece and I'm glad to have it! However... I also ordered a three shelf version in Amber Pine.  It was also beautiful but I noticed problems as soon as I started to assemble it.  The screws just turned and turned and turned.  It was like the pre-drilled holes were just too big.  Nonetheless, I hoped for the best.  But when I turned the shelf to screw in the other side, the screws broke through the wood (as pictured).  Some duct tape and longer screws from my own collection later... I got it assembled.  I didn't want to return it because I love the look of the wood grain... plus at that point I'd spent well over an hour working on it.  I think for the money it really should be in a better condition than what I can get at Walmart for half the price.

Read more View Image Gallery Amazon Customer 5.0 out of 5 stars Images in this review Reviews with images See all photos Previous page Next page All photos Amazon Customer 5 out of 5 stars Super fast shipping First thing.. I ordered this on the 19th evening and received it on the 21st before 4:00pm. That’s super fast shipping! This color was labeled as dark grey. I bought it bc it was the cheapest one and I can get more pillow covers (25x30 each btw) made to go with my warm colors in my boho farmhouse style if it was too cold but the color in natural daylight is more of a dark denim which I’m very happy with! It’s not as dark as the listing picture. In my photos I paired with a light cream, a yellow, a black/white checkered blanket and a neutral camel/beige pillow to hopefully get the camera to see what the closest I could get to actual color. As far as build… I was done in about 25mins bc I have experience with all the orders from amazon. I did have to flip a piece over which meant I had to lay it on its side to shimmy one out in order to get it together correctly. I can see how it could take someone a while to do if you don’t have any experience. All parts were labeled correctly and no parts leftover. If I were to buy another chair I would assemble each arm square first then the three support bars, fabric sling then other square all while it’s on its side. I allowed pillows 48hrs to fluff (periodically manually fluffing to hurry the process) before putting on the cases and the base has adjustable feet if it’s not level. Nice, sturdy, big chair! Build in the room it’s going in or you’ll have to unscrew the 3 bars that support the seat. Also Thank you to the couple who posted a pic of them sitting in the chairs…helped tremendously in my decision to buy!

Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024 Color: Dark Grey Verified Purchase I love these chairs, two with the dark gray fabric as they were the lowest price. Assembly is a bit finicky with getting screws started into threads, but no biggie. Just don’t tighten them all the way until chair parts are all together. And do leave out and fluff the cushions for a few days before using.  Totally worth the effort. Set up and enjoy! I might eventually sew new cushion  covers with some sort of pattern, but the gray looks very chic.

It's a little bigger than I thought it would be but it's fine. Very easy to put together, 2 tools to assist( a ratchet and Allen key), 1 extra screw, no damage. The instructions were somewhat confusing for one person, it helped to have a friend there. Very comfortable and elegant.

Jessica 5.0 out of 5 stars Looks great Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2024 Color: Walnut Style: Barn Doors TV Stand Verified Purchase This TV stand requires two people to assemble it, but I did it on my own. I like how it complements the rest of my wood furniture. The instructional booklet was simple to follow. I was worried it was going to be unsteady, but with all of the pieces put together, it turned out solid. All the pieces are labeled with numbers, which are easy to remove with scraper and some goo gone. Obviously, it’s not completely made of wood, so being extra careful in placing and drilling the screws will prevent cracking. I did make a few mistakes as I assembled it alone, but they’re all inside the frame, therefore out of view. I’m very happy with the product.

Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024 Color: Gray Wash Style: Barn Doors TV Stand Verified Purchase I really love the product. At first when I was putting the stand together it seems flimsy but once it’s all put together it’s very sturdy. The only thing that didn’t stay in place was the little pieces the hold the shelves in the cabinet they kept falling out but I hot glued it so it worked fine. It took a little over 2 hours to put together with two people. Only because the instructions are only pictures there’s no word telling what to do lol but it was still helpful.. if your looking for something affordable and nice get it!

It was pretty simple to put together. Some of the pieces came damaged and after putting it together it was not worth returning it due to small damages. I wish the pieces would have came in better shape.

They just show pictures and you have to guess how to put it together. The instructions are not detailed at all. They do not give you any extra parts. Where is the screw? You used to pull in the pins, if you overtighten them at all by hand, they break again they give you nothing extra instructions vague overall looks good but we’re not purchase again. It’s all particleboard.

It was fairly simple to put together and very sturdy. You will need a drill at one point because there were screws for one of the steps but no pre made holes. Great buy for the price.

Glad to say I found this one as I perfectly suited my needs. That being said, there were a few things to note- the first being that shipping was delayed not once but twice. Both times I was not notified of a delay until the day of the supposed arrival. So getting this much later than expected was a little disappointing to say the least. Secondly, the instructions did not provide details on how to attach the reinforcement bars at the back at all. Other than that, it was easy enough to put together on my own(a 19yr old with minimal experience), was pretty sturdy considering the price, drawers were functional, and it fit perfectly where I wanted it. It wasn’t too heavy to move on my own either. My kitten approves as well, as he actively inserted himself in the lowest drawer to check things out lol.

Sure the draws are very flimsy, but what do you expect for a piece of furniture that is that inexpensive! Yes, it’s  small but that’s what I wanted for the place where I put it.

Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024 Size: 3 Drawers Color: Black Oak Verified Purchase It's a bit smaller than I expected, which isn't a complaint, I was actually happy with the size. It was easy to put together, all the pieces were clearly labeled, and it comes with all the tools you need to put it together so there's no need to buy anything extra. You can do the screws by hand so no need for a drill. The instructions were clear and concise; I was able to put it together in about 20 minutes. It would be easier with a second person but of you hold it right you can do it by yourself as well. It's incredibly lightweight so you can move it easily as needed. Color is a nice, rich black color. Wood and metal are both sturdy. Drawers are decent sized too. Read more 14 people found this helpful Helpful Report Cynthia W. 5.0 out of 5 stars Classy fabric drawers? Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024 Size: 4 Drawers Color: Rustic Brown Verified Purchase No missing pieces, perfect size for our purposes, and much sturdier than expected. We had plenty of screws. It was easy to assemble and the metal handles along with the wood printed fabric drawers make this dresser/nightstand thing much classier than you would expect. My grandmother (with only nice, solid wood furniture) wanted a small set of drawers for my daughter's (who semi-lives with her) junk. This looks classy enough that it doesn't look out of place, has enough room to help my kid be organized, and was inexpensive enough to fit the bill.

It's very cute. I will say the drawers are not wood so don't be fooled! But it seems sturdy enough. Assemble was pretty easy too. It took me about three hours to finish building it by myself. I love the 5 drawer mostly because they're a bit smaller than I expected.  They're great if you need more space to organize your things. I will say that some of the metal pieces came damaged unfortunately but I personally don't mind too much just because I faced the damaged parts inwards so they weren't visible. If that is something you want to avoid I wouldn't recommend these. Other than that I think they're great!

Images in this review 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report Marian 5.0 out of 5 stars Attractive, useful lamps Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024 Color: Seeded Clear Verified Purchase We're using these attractive lamps as our bedside table lamps. They work extremely well in that capacity. Each lamp has a fairly heavy base, so it won't  fall over or slide around on a table (a problem we had with a previous small lamp). The dimmer switch (which also turns on the lamp) goes from very low light to VERY bright, making the lamp useful for anything from just ambience to whatever you need bright light for. (However, these ARE LED bulbs, so their "yellow" light isn't really yellow. I dislike the whitish light so I'm replacing the bulbs.) The electrical outlet on the top of the base is a plus, and also very useful, as are the USB ports for phone or Kindle or other device charging. These lamps are available in a handful of metal colors and shade colors/textures. They are also inexpensive These are better than I was expecting. I'm very happy with them.

Glad to say I found this one as I perfectly suited my needs. That being said, there were a few things to note- the first being that shipping was delayed not once but twice. Both times I was not notified of a delay until the day of the supposed arrival. So getting this much later than expected was a little disappointing to say the least. Secondly, the instructions did not provide details on how to attach the reinforcement bars at the back at all. Other than that, it was easy enough to put together on my own(a 19yr old with minimal experience), was pretty sturdy considering the price, drawers were functional, and it fit perfectly where I wanted it. It wasn’t too heavy to move on my own either. My kitten approves as well, as he actively inserted himself in the lowest drawer to check things out lol.

Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2024 Size: 5 Drawers Color: Vintage Floral Verified Purchase I love this so much! It was a little smaller than I anticipated, but if you buy 2 of them and put them together it would look great! There’s lots of other great options as well but this goes great beside my bed, and I can put all of my intimate items in the drawers to make more room in my main dresser. Super lightweight, super durable, and easy to put together! It can fit quite a few clothes! Read more Just don't get Peony Rose😭 5.0 out of 5 stars So cute!!!! Great for dorms!

Sure the draws are very flimsy, but what do you expect for a piece of furniture that is that inexpensive! Yes, it’s  small but that’s what I wanted for the place where I put it.

Images in this review 5 people found this helpful Helpful Report Raven Young 5.0 out of 5 stars Love it!!! Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024 Size: 3 Drawers Color: Black Oak Verified Purchase It's a bit smaller than I expected, which isn't a complaint, I was actually happy with the size. It was easy to put together, all the pieces were clearly labeled, and it comes with all the tools you need to put it together so there's no need to buy anything extra. You can do the screws by hand so no need for a drill. The instructions were clear and concise; I was able to put it together in about 20 minutes. It would be easier with a second person but of you hold it right you can do it by yourself as well. It's incredibly lightweight so you can move it easily as needed. Color is a nice, rich black color. Wood and metal are both sturdy. Drawers are decent sized too. Read more 14 people found this helpful Helpful Report Cynthia W. 5.0 out of 5 stars Classy fabric drawers? Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024 Size: 4 Drawers Color: Rustic Brown Verified Purchase No missing pieces, perfect size for our purposes, and much sturdier than expected. We had plenty of screws. It was easy to assemble and the metal handles along with the wood printed fabric drawers make this dresser/nightstand thing much classier than you would expect. My grandmother (with only nice, solid wood furniture) wanted a small set of drawers for my daughter's (who semi-lives with her) junk. This looks classy enough that it doesn't look out of place, has enough room to help my kid be organized, and was inexpensive enough to fit the bill.

It's very cute. I will say the drawers are not wood so don't be fooled! But it seems sturdy enough. Assemble was pretty easy too. It took me about three hours to finish building it by myself. I love the 5 drawer mostly because they're a bit smaller than I expected.  They're great if you need more space to organize your things. I will say that some of the metal pieces came damaged unfortunately but I personally don't mind too much just because I faced the damaged parts inwards so they weren't visible. If that is something you want to avoid I wouldn't recommend these. Other than that I think they're great!

We have used the same type of shoe rack for years, so we thought we would try out this Z&L HOUSE 4-Tier stackable Shoe Rack for our closet.All the parts were there, and everything fit together well.  Our only complaint is that is it somewhat flimsy.  It is made from bamboo, which is what we wanted, but since it does not have a stabilizing bar in the center, the shelves sag in the middle if you put any weight on it at all.  Plus, shoe boxes, or larger size shoes, will stick out the front by an inch or two.  I attached a picture to show this.So….if you are only going to put smaller, flatter walking shoes without boxes on this rack you are all good.  If you have bigger shoes, golf shoes, or high top sneakers you might not want this.  But for the money, this is a nice shoe rack.Recommended.

This little shoe rack aspires to be the fanciest shoe rack in the world and I’m rooting for it. Until its dreams come true, I’m hoping it will continue holding my shoes and not cave in like a dying star. Also, Chihuahua for scale. His name is Riley and he’s very old but even he respects the shoe rack. Be like Riley, shoe some respect. TL:DR: I kind of like it for its basic design, annoying to build and horrendous quality. I’d recommend it for someone who wants a shoe rack but can’t justify spending $30+ on Amazon anymore. It’s awful but I’ve come to love its simplicity.

I will start by saying that I do have a large electric/motorized standing desk at my home office which I enjoy and you really can’t beat the convenience of adjusting automatically. However, I went on vacation and had to do some school work so I was looking for something affordable. I found this gem and purchased it with really no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at its stability. I am very tall and at the highest height works well for standing and it fit my needs. The manual adjustment takes some getting used to but I figured that out. The weight of the box was not that heavy and it was easy to put together in under 20 mins. Appearance wise, the table top is sleek and has ample width for me to be able to fit my laptop and my portable monitor with room for a few books.  I drove so of course I decided to take this home with me and it will be coming with me for future road trips. I recently had emergency surgery and of course this is helping me during my recovery to keep up with my work as you can see from the picture. I’m glad I purchased this. If you aren’t able to splurge on a motorized desk, this is awesome and I am glad I now have the convenience of changing my work space and not confined to my basement all day lol!

Lott 3.0 out of 5 stars Not Easily Adjustable Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024 Color: Rustic Verified Purchase Positives: --Color of the desktop --Desktop has a good amount of space, but small enough to easily tuck the table in a corner --Assembly was fairly straightforward, I figured it out --If you wanted to use it with a walking pad, it feels sturdy and probably wide enough Negatives (sorry y'all): --I figured assembly out but the instructions could have been more clear. It was a lot of tiny diagrams and arrows. --Height is adjusted by removing/inserting two very LONG screw-in knobs. You'll be screwing/unscrewing until the end of time! There are two other shorter knobs facing outward from the front of the desk. I have no idea what these are for - they do not help with height adjustment. I thought that I had used the incorrect knobs but the shorter knobs don't fit in the holes on the side of the desk. --For when you're in a seated position: there is a bar connecting the legs together underneath the table. I am unable to sit completely underneath it (with the desk touching my torso) without bumping my legs on the bar. I'm not a tall person - 5'3" / 160.02 cm. To be fair, the product description gave measurements/photos and it's intended to be more of a standing desk anyway. If you're looking for a desk that easily adjusts between standing/sitting, this may not be the one for you. If you want to use it only in the standing position, go for it!

Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024 Color: Rustic Verified Purchase This is a great desk for the price. Easy to put together and is easy to raise and lower. This is perfect for a home office. I bought 2 and have 1 at the highest point and the other at the lowest. The higher holds monitors and the lower my keyboard and mouse. Works great for standing desk. Screws were easy to install, light weight desk but is definitely sturdy enough.

I wanted to ensure I could watch myself to avoid injuries due to poor posture or positioning. The mirrors seem like good quality with no visible defects, and I was able to line them up straight and even on the wall. However, the directions for installation are pretty vague, and there is definitely not enough glue included, so plan to buy some more! I also suggest using a laser level to ensure the pieces line up evenly on your wall before gluing them down. Four mirrors at the 16x12 inch size don’t provide a nice full body view, so I had to purchase two sets. Overall, they are a good addition to my home gym.

Images in this review Helpful Report Katherine & Mick 5.0 out of 5 stars Nice Mirror Tiles Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024 Size: 14''x12''-4PCS Verified Purchase I bought this for my eleven year old daughter's room -- for the back of the door.  Was difficult to find those types of mirrors locally.  On Amazon, full length mirrors were fairly pricey most likely due to the shipping size.  I stumbled upon these in my search and after reading the reviews decided they should work well. They do work well.  The tiles come well packaged in separate tiles which you can "assemble" in way you want.  I assembled them in a row vertically and the seems are not really a factor in terms of obstructing view or being distracting.  The "image" is good with clear reflection and no odd distorted effects. They all arrived intact and had no damage. These are actual glass tiles not the plastic mirror-like material you often see with behind-the-door mirrors.  As a result, I was also concerned with their weight as I didn't want to risk heavy glass panels falling in my daughter's room.  These are actually fairly thin -- which worked well for my application.  They come with more than enough double sided mounting tape and they hold very well.  No concern whatsoever that these will fall. If you are looking for some easily mountable glass panels -- especially for the back of the door -- these will work well for you.  Price was fair and quality seems very good.  As for longevity, they are in place firmly and I don't see anyone disturbing them on the back of the door so I anticipate it will last a long time.

Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023 Size: 14''x12''-16PCS Verified Purchase I bought two 24 packs of the 12"x14" mirror tiles for my home gym project, which gave me an 8' wide x 5' tall mirror. It's not perfect (pros and cons below), but I still love it and am very satisfied with this purchase! Pros: 1) I love that I was able to build a giant mirror for only about $180 (after buying 3m Command Strips as an alternative installation option). 2) Easy and cheap shipping (they come in a very small box). 3) Easy install (with 3m Command Strips you can remove the tiles and put them back up as many times as needed to get it perfect). 4) Modular and scalable you can set them up in any configuration or shape you want and expand/add more later. 5) If you move to a new place, you can take them with you (just buy more Command Strips). 6) The tiles look like real mirrors. 7) Speedy delivery. Cons: 1) Distorted image or gaps between tiles. If you put them right up against eachother the cracks distort the image. If you put a small gap between them it looks better but then you have tiny gaps. With the 3m Command Strips, I was able to do lots of trial and error to get the most seamless mirror possible, but it's still not absolutely perfect. 2) The sticky stuff they provide (glue and double sided sticky foam) will ruin a wall if you need to remove them (see other reviews). This is where the 3m Command Strips come in. I got the "small" size and cut them in half, putting one in each corner of every tile, and haven't had a single issue. These added about $40 to my total project cost, but is well worth it for the ease of installation, removal and moveability. All in all, I would go this route again if I ever have to set up another home gym on a budget. It is a very affordable and easy way to have a huge mirror. You just have to decide if you want small gaps between tiles or a fun house effect along the edges, which still beats spending a thousand dollars on a giant heavy mirror in my opinion. I went with the funhouse option, but it doesn't bother me when I think about how much money I saved. Read more Fuchsia Angel 4.0 out of 5 stars Great option for a fraction of the price!

The instructions were clear and it was easy to install. Word of caution : please mark the area with a pencil where you actually want to stick it and make sure the wall is even and plain. The sticker and glue is super strong and slight up and down will make it impossible to take it off unless you want to destroy it. The warping issue which most of them complain can be taken care by leaving a minor gap between the glasses. Overall as quite happy and satisfied with the product for the price and quality Read more 23 people found this helpful Helpful Report Jim Denier 5.0 out of 5 stars Should be 4.5 stars. Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2024 Size: 14''x12''-8PCS Verified Purchase One came cracked so losing a half a star isn't so bad.  Product wise they are the good kind of 'cheap' if that makes sense.  They look solid, no deformation, but very delicate edges.  Initially hanging a mirror on a wall with sticky tape (not your only option) seemed a bit dicey.  That good kind of 'cheap' I was talking about is how light and plasticy they feel.  Before I turned the first one over to see how reflective it was I assumed I would be returning them for that reason alone.  Once they are on the wall you have the same effect as if you spent a lot more so I would purchase these again as my business tends to require plenty of mirrors.

Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024 Size: 14''x12''-16PCS Verified Purchase At first, while sticking the mirrors on the wall, I found them very nice-looking and easy to install. The packaging is very secure as well. It comes with double-sided stickers that are very strong, along with glue. However, after I finished installing them on the wall, I noticed that the reflection was distorted and uneven. Read more Feru 3.0 out of 5 stars Nice but the reflection is distorted and uneven.

Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024 Color: Light Grey Size: Queen Style: Modern Verified Purchase I've put together a lot of furniture over the years.  This bed is sturdy!  The parts were good quality and the instructions easy to follow.  It only takes a single included allen wrench to assemble.  The wrench could be better to ease assembly but its a one time use and then thrown away.  The fit and finish is good.  While the headboard isn't grand or plush, it simple and elegant.  Once completely assembled the bed is sturdy.  At first the wood slats seem undersized, but once the mattress is on I couldn't tell.  It would take an adult to jump up and down on the mattress to possibly break it.  Don't plan on putting heavy items in the drawers as they are wire baskets on wheels.  They are great for winter clothes, wrapping paper, spare linens etc..  I'm using this bed in a guest room.  It would be great for kids/teen bedrooms and if your on a budget the master bedroom.  5 for sturdiness, style, and assembly.  4 on the drawers.  This is a post assembly review, not a long term review.

We've wanted a bed like this for a long time, but were hoping we'd find one that wasn't a platform bed. We couldn't pass up the deal on this, so went ahead and ordered it. Installation wasn't hard at all. The bed is very sturdy and eye appealing. My main downfall is the drawers. They seem very flimsy and get stuck...a lot. Other than that, great bed!

The frame itself is super sturdy and stable, all metal pieces and thick screws/bolts, with very precise dimensions not allowing it to wiggle around at all, so it's squeak-free so far. Every piece was labeled and the instructions pamphlet was easy to follow, with all the screws and other tiny pieces very well-packaged and labeled as well. The cloth on the headboard, footboard and draws is soft and decent quality. The gray is bit better-looking in person than in the photos, it should be pretty versatile to work with your decor. Pros: - very solid, sturdy - easy-ish assembly (lot of steps, but easy-to-follow instructions) - very, very high quality for the price - great engineering Cons: - it's super heavy when assembled, you will likely have to disassemble it to move it to another home - the wooden support slats use thick plastic pegs instead of bolts to attach to the frame; the pegs may dry-rot over time and need to be replaced with bolts Summary: I'm super happy with this purchase, and honestly think it will be worth the disassembly and reassembly for our next move. If it suits your fashion, I highly recommend.

Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024 Color: Dark Grey Size: King Style: Modern Verified Purchase I recently upgraded to the Allewie Upholstered King Size Platform Bed Frame with 4 Storage Drawers and Headboard, and it has exceeded all expectations, earning a solid 5-star rating. This bed frame seamlessly blends style with functionality, providing a luxurious sleeping space with added storage convenience. Design and Construction: The upholstered headboard adds a touch of sophistication, creating a focal point in the bedroom. The neutral color complements various decor styles, allowing for easy integration into any room. The quality of the upholstery is evident, providing both comfort and durability. Storage Drawers: The four spacious storage drawers integrated into the bed frame are a game-changer for those seeking additional space in the bedroom. These drawers effortlessly slide in and out, offering a discreet and organized solution for storing extra linens, clothing, or personal items. The design ensures that the drawers are seamlessly integrated, maintaining the overall aesthetic appeal of the bed. Sturdiness and Support: The platform design eliminates the need for a box spring, providing excellent support for the mattress. The construction is robust, and the bed frame feels solid and secure. Even with the added storage drawers, there is no compromise on stability. Easy Assembly: One notable feature is the straightforward assembly process. The instructions are clear, and all necessary tools are provided. The bed frame came together seamlessly, and I appreciated the attention to detail in the assembly instructions. Overall Comfort: Beyond its practical features, the Allewie bed frame offers a comfortable and inviting sleeping space. The padded headboard provides a supportive surface for sitting up and reading or watching TV. In conclusion, the Allewie Upholstered King Size Platform Bed Frame has transformed my bedroom into a stylish and organized sanctuary. It's a perfect blend of elegance and practicality, and the added storage drawers are a true asset. If you're in search of a high-quality, functional, and aesthetically pleasing bed frame, look no further. Highly recommended!

I just moved into a new apartment and have limited space and this was perfect to fit in the corner of my living room. I haven't really organized it yet, just threw books on it for this photo. I imagine as I add more books, I'll probably mount it on the wall but for now it works as is. It took me probably an hour and a half to assemble and I only had one hiccup when it came to adding the last back panel. There are videos to assist you online which was nice. All the pieces necessary to assemble were included. This is ideal for limited space and if you want something a bit different than a traditional bookshelf.

Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024 Color: Grey Verified Purchase I recently re-did the spare bedroom to turn it into a home office/hobby room.  I had a weird little spot in the room that needed something but not much would fit there.  This was the problem solver!  I got into the Sarah Maas books and it holds all of her current books perfectly and looks absolutely adorable while doing so. Easy to assemble, light weight and holds a lot. Her books are huge and I could fit all of them on there.  If you have a bunch of regular sized books, this could hold a TON.  It's not super tall, either.  I'm 5'5 and it comes to just under my chest. Perfect little bookcase to keep a series together or to fill in an empty space.

Great for small spaces, but still fits plenty of books as you can see in my picture. Height-wise, I’m just shy of 5’4” and it comes up to about my underbust. We did not do the wall anchor thing, and it is a *tad* wobbly at times even with heavier books at the bottom. But still decently sturdy & good quality, especially for the price. This took my husband about an hour to assemble, but said once got the pattern it made sense. His critique is that the instructions weren’t as clear as he prefers and there were a lot of extra parts, so it was a little confusing. But he also didn’t want to watch the reviewer assembly tips video, sooo 🤷🏻‍♀️ Read more Sara 4.0 out of 5 stars Cute & study little book tree Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023 I was looking for an affordable bookshelf that wouldn’t be too large or bulky for the limited available space in my living room - and this was perfect!

I did not use the wall anchor because my computer/craft room does not get much traffic and we don't have small kids.  However, since I bought two of these, I placed them side by side and I used some heavy books to straddle the two lower boxes/bases.  This both makes the stands more stable and serves as a horizontal shelf for these oversized books. I would prefer that these were real wood not compressed boards that are covered with wood-grain cover.  That's my only negative comment.

Sturdy as well.  Looks good by the door or in hallway.

For normal books it would be fine, but I bought this for homeschooling, so the textbooks hang over quite a bit. It did however hold all of it and didn't break, so I can't complain. Super cute, space effective, and sturdy as long as you have it anchored to the wall or put heavy stuff in the bottom shelf (I put my teacher keys). I would buy again, even knowing what I know.

The headboard is not as tall as it is in the image. Also, there were 2 extra wood slabs labeled “14” that were not used or included in the assembly video. A drill is only needed for the very last step. Some Slabs were uneven and some does not reach fully from L to R.

This bed is super cute and wasn’t hard to put together but it’s VERY weak and not sturdy at all. I didn’t even attempt to sleep on it until I could add more sturdiness. I went to my local home improvement store and added (24) 11” wood pieces ( 2 per horizontal slat ) and (2) 10” wood pieces ( 1 per vertical vertical slat ). Measurements are as so because of how the horizontal slats lay on top of the vertical slats but trust me they are accurate. Including wood screws, it only costed me about $25 and the store cut the pieces for me. *disclaimer I DO OWN A POWER DRILL so this was an easy fix* The bed is VERY sturdy now & does not budge whatsoever.

We have used the same type of shoe rack for years, so we thought we would try out this Z&L HOUSE 4-Tier stackable Shoe Rack for our closet.All the parts were there, and everything fit together well.  Our only complaint is that is it somewhat flimsy.  It is made from bamboo, which is what we wanted, but since it does not have a stabilizing bar in the center, the shelves sag in the middle if you put any weight on it at all.  Plus, shoe boxes, or larger size shoes, will stick out the front by an inch or two.  I attached a picture to show this.So….if you are only going to put smaller, flatter walking shoes without boxes on this rack you are all good.  If you have bigger shoes, golf shoes, or high top sneakers you might not want this.  But for the money, this is a nice shoe rack.Recommended.

This little shoe rack aspires to be the fanciest shoe rack in the world and I’m rooting for it. Until its dreams come true, I’m hoping it will continue holding my shoes and not cave in like a dying star. Also, Chihuahua for scale. His name is Riley and he’s very old but even he respects the shoe rack. Be like Riley, shoe some respect. TL:DR: I kind of like it for its basic design, annoying to build and horrendous quality. I’d recommend it for someone who wants a shoe rack but can’t justify spending $30+ on Amazon anymore. It’s awful but I’ve come to love its simplicity.

I love my new bed! It was simple to put together, only took me and my boyfriend about 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. I gave it only 4 stars simply because of the gas lifts!!! They took forever to mess with and my boyfriend could NOT, no matter how hard he tried, get the lifts to move!!! We took them off and he pushed down on them with all of his body weight (he's 6' tall & weighs 210) and still, not one inch!!! He was quickly irritated by the whole thing and gave up on them so I contacted the Allewie company who made the bed to try to get new parts.They emailed me back and told us to try it again but this time with the mattress on the bed. If after doing that the lifts still weren't working then they would send us new parts.I bought this bed on May 3rd and it was delivered by Amazon a few days later. So it's been just about three weeks since we assembled the bed together. So today before we tried to mess with it again, I read through the all of the negative reviews on Amazon expecting to find a lot of complaints about the lifts but there were 3 (there aren't that many total that are negative which shocked me)!!! One of them said basically the guy had the same issue we were having. He said he tried one week later and suddenly the lifts moved without any issues so.... I held up the bed while my boyfriend put the lifts on but he wasn't going to put the little screws on it until we tried to see if it worked first and sure enough!! I pushed on it with one hand and it started going down!! He still didn't believe me so he told me to push it down all the way and then go back up before he did anything else with it. So I tried and I  swear that it moves as smooth as butter  both up and down with only one hand!!!! I am so excited because I love the bed and the only problem I had was not being able to access the storage underneath without my boyfriend holding up the mattress!Sooo if you are reading this because you are having trouble getting the lifts to work, don't give up!!! Wait a bit, a few days or a week or two and try it again... Hopefully you'll have the same luck as I (and that other guy) did!!!Otherwise it's beautiful and I have zero complaints! I took pics of my bed down with some of my new stuff on it (it's a work in progress right now) and I love how it looks already!! I can't wait to see the finished product!!

The box is heavy but I managed to get it up two flights of stairs with some patience. I'd recommend two people ideally, but I managed bearhugging it step by step I received all the parts and the two tools required. My greatest concern was the air jacks, as there were other reviews that had problems with them. Mine work as expected. Assembly took a couple hours, but it looks great. The quality of the materials are very good for the price, I think. The frame is sturdy and offers abundant storage space beneath.

It was easy to assemble, my son and I started assembling it was easier to read than an ikea manual. My husband and son finished building it. We did try adding the box spring, but it would have been too tall and cove the headboard, so we decided to go without. The mattress had plenty of support. The bed frame is sturdy and doesn’t squeak, it’s a good height as well.  Good value for the money. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Report Jagger Lulanaj 5.0 out of 5 stars Great choice for limited space Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024 Size: Queen Style: Modern Color: Beige Verified Purchase Living in a somewhat small apartment means that space-saving solutions are more than just convenient—they're essential. That's where the Allewie Queen Size Lift Up Storage Bed comes into play, blending functionality with classic style in a way that enhances both the aesthetics and utility of my living space. The standout feature of this bed is undoubtedly its lift-up storage mechanism. Supported by hydraulics, the bed frame easily lifts to reveal a generous storage area underneath. While the frame is admittedly heavy, the hydraulic system significantly reduces the effort needed to access the storage space. Although it requires some force to lift, especially with a heavy mattress, this is a minor trade-off for the convenience and extra storage provided. The modern wingback headboard adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to the bed's overall design. It not only enhances the bed's appearance but also offers sturdy and comfortable support for reading or relaxing in bed. The classic style of the headboard makes this bed a versatile piece that fits seamlessly with various decor styles, making it ideal for anyone looking to upgrade their bedroom aesthetics. Durability and stability are key components of this bed's design. Once raised, the frame feels very sturdy, and there's no fear of it unexpectedly falling or dropping, which gives me peace of mind every time I use the storage feature. In conclusion, the Allewie Queen Size Lift Up Storage Bed is a fantastic choice for anyone with limited space who doesn't want to compromise on functionality/space saving. The added storage is a game-changer for small apartments, and the ease of use, coupled with its elegant design, makes this bed a valuable addition to any bedroom. Highly recommended for its practicality and streamlined look! Read more 34 people found this helpful Helpful Report Kelly Davis 5.0 out of 5 stars Great bed! Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024 Size: Queen Style: Modern Color: Beige Verified Purchase Box arrived VERY heavy and really beat up, one end was torn open and a rain storm was coming so I had to scoot it into the garage before it rained, then carried the pieces inside. Queen size bed looks very nice in the room, surprisingly sturdy.  Beige color definitely leans more to gray than brown, we currently have beige walls that have more yellow tone in it and the beige bed looks gray against the wall.  Which is fine we are painting the room anyway.  Assembly took a couple of evenings after work and does at one point require 2 people to install the springs.  At first we put our old innerspring mattress on it and it lifted super easy.  Then we put the new Novaform foam mattress from Costco on it and it is noticeably heavier to lift.  Still doable by an able-bodied person but it definitely takes more oomph to lift.  Love all the storage under - we fit a pack n play, extra blankets, pillows and still quite a bit of room.  I admit putting things underneath up by the headboard makes me a bit nervous going under there because that mattress is heavy although the bed has given me no reason to think it will collapse, just the thought of it. All in all very pleased with this bed and considering buying a second. Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Report HLB 5.0 out of 5 stars Great storage and Assembly Instructions Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024 Size: Full Style: Modern Color: Beige Verified Purchase I ordered this bed for a tiny bedroom. The box it is shipped in is heavy, and I needed my husband’s help to get it in house. Once I opened the box I had a slight panic attack over all the parts to assemble, but the instructions were easy to follow. It took me less than an hour to build myself, and I only needed my husband’s help during one of the steps which is lowering the storage component the first time - since it takes some strength for first use of the gas pump (I could have probably done it myself, although instructions say to use two people). Overall it is a nice bed and storage is great. The bed frame goes up and down easily to access storage. The fabric is just OK for headboard and the side seam is noticeable, but for price and the room I am using it in, I have no complaints and it looks nice and is great. I got the beige and it is definitely more grey. The bed is very sturdy and doesn’t wobble at all.

Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2023 Size: 4-Tier Verified Purchase This actually works great for most sizes of children's books, and so far seems pretty sturdy.  I was worried it might be a tipping hazard  for my toddler before I bought it, but after 1 month of use I am not still concerned.  (We put heavier books on the bottom and lightweight DVDs / stuffed animals on the top).  If I was really paranoid I might have left off the top shelf, to make it 25% shorter,  ( I think they sell a shorter one, too)  but so far the 4-shelf version seems to handle daily usage in the nursery just fine. The wood shelves are secured with hex-head wood-screws , tools and gloves are included,  and installation went fine except for one very minor crack while tightening one upper side-piece.  Overall,  tolerances and design seem pretty good for an affordable flat-packed spinning shelf.  My kid likes turning it and picking out books to read at bedtime. This books handles ~90% of kids books just fine (Tall ones, short ones,  big ones, small ones) However, there is one book shape that it is not good for:  Some kids books (like "P is for Pterodactyl)  have short heights and really long page-widths.  ( approx ~8.5" H x11.25W) . For these books you probably should use a different shelf, because they will stick out too far and fall off easily  unless  rotated vertically.  But again, this issue affects is less than 10% of our kid's books.  The good news that it handles even fairly large format books quite well, eg, "Daullieres' Book of Greek Myths" fits fine once the shelf is filled.

It is a bit difficult to turn, which is the only reason I have 4.5 stars instead of 5.

Because of this, I was looking for something affordable but made of real wood. I ended up giving this rotating 5-tier bookcase a shot & am so happy I did! Assembly took less than an hour and was near impossible to get wrong. It the perfect size for any space and holds a good amount of books (mine currently holds 118 books of varying sizes with room for about 5 more). Thinking about painting it eventually but will wait until the rest of the room is finished… it will be easy to paint since it is raw wood. No complaints here! This bookcase is definitely worth giving a spin!

I had run out of wall space for traditional bookshelves, so I am very glad that I found this rotating alternative. The two photos show the first one I got for under my desk and a brand-new one that I just assembled today. I read the negative reviews and they do not match my experience: all the wood was nicely sanded, the packaging was extremely well done (with only a small amount of styrofoam and plastic for the garbage), and loaded up with books, the shelf spins easily and feels very sturdy. Highly recommended.

Vertically, I can get 10 In each slot, 40 on each tier, 160 on full unit.  I can add another 5 per slot horizontally if necessary (80 more cases) 😁.  That would be 240 cases. 😱😁👍 I also found paper pumpkin boxes for 3 per slot. Convenient! The unit was easy to build. Unfinished wood could have been sealed, stained, painted before building. I liked the raw look. All edges are sanded so no splinters.  Brass screws. Solid, no wobble.  I had only one baffle (side ends) crack at the bottom when screwed in place. Not very noticeable.  The top is not a finished look. I will have it covered so I didn't care. The box came screws and only took necessary to build. Also a couple surprises arrived:  white knit gloves to help get some torque when turning the screws. And a vinyl golden doily for the top. 😁👍 Highly recommend for crafters storage. Perfect for my needs. Read more Sam C 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for stamp Dvd cases Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022 I bought this 4 tier unit to hold stamp cases.

It's relatively sturdy and holds a lot of books.  However, the assembly instructions were vague and frustrating.  Instead of receiving a screwdriver and screws, this bookshelf came with an allen wrench and bolts.  It was very difficult to use the allen wrench in some of the fastener locations.

It assembled very easily in under 20 minutes.  The bookcasr is sturdy and absolutely beautiful.  The spin is slow and controlled allowing for safe child use.  I would highly recommend this product.  The box even came with a pair of gloves, sand paper ( neither were required ) screws and an Allan Key.  I may have to buy a second one.

The size is perfect. Not too bulky or heavy to move but still very sturdy. The color works great with my tv stand. Was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to assemble - with the help of my daughter and her small power drill. My only words of caution, for those with little ones, the ends are very pointy and sharp. But thanks to Amazon’s same day delivery, I was able to buy small silicone caps to cover the corners.

Read more Helpful Report Amazon_Name 5.0 out of 5 stars A great mid century coffee table for a reasonable price. Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2024 Color: Espresso Size: 39.37"D x 19.69"W x 16.93"H Verified Purchase I needed a coffee table and I saw this one and read the reviews so I went for it. Overall, it's a nice piece. The finish seems a little fragile so use coasters and don't put anything with rough edges on it. If a big dog jumps up on this, it's all over. The pull-up table is okay but a touch wobbly. I really don't use that part of it but I do enjoy the storage. My only issue is that it's rather small once you get it set up. I'd love the table more if it was twice as long. Also, they should really pre-assemble this and just ship it so you screw the legs on it (I got a file cabinet like that so I know they can do it). Anyway, I really can't complain for the price. I gave it a lot of stars because I needed one and this works. Also, it showed up on my doorstep so I didn't have to go to the store, deal with salespeople, wait a month, schedule the delivery. It just showed up with Prime. I'd recommend and I'd get this again for another room. I hope this helps you make an informed decision.

After some quick comparisons to other brands and reading reviews, I chose this one.  The reluctancy was due to the material as I know MDF is just not a long term solution. Putting it together was actually a breeze, I don't really understand the negative reviews mentioning this because I was able to put this together in about half an hour - The instructions, although minimal, are pretty clear and simple. Overall it actually is pretty nice and the size was perfect for my family room which is fairly small.  My one issue is with the lift top itself - it's pretty awkward to lift and wobbly.  I'm afraid over time this will only proceed to get worse but I knew going into this that this coffee table was not a long term solution but good enough for at least a 2 year life span if taken care of properly. Long story short:  For a lower budget option, the look is very nice and if styled correctly can really stand out.  The biggest drawback is the sturdiness of the lifts and ease of use of the lift feature.

Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2024 Color: Charcoal Black Size: 39.37"D x 19.69"W x 16.93"H Verified Purchase If you are the person who sleeps in a futton or couch, then works at the couch doing zoom calls and eats while watching Youtube videos from your ipad or computer - THIS IS YOUR ANSWER!. You do not need to scoot down. It also serves a storage unit - documents, books, desk things, plates, or in my case, my clothes. It was a filling area for papers. It was hard to assemble this though. It took me maybe an hour or more since I misunderstood a direction, so I had to redo some re-assembling which was still ok. It's on a pricier side but for the many purposes it has (storage, work desk, coffee stable, paper organizer), it's probably worth your money.

Not only does it offer a sleek and modern design that elevates my living space, but it also provides practical storage solutions that make organization a breeze. The hidden compartment offers a discreet space to store away clutter and keep my living room looking neat and tidy. Whether it's small blankets, remote controls, magazines, or other odds and ends, I love having a designated spot to tuck away items while still keeping them easily accessible. What sets this coffee table apart is its adjustable storage shelf. With the ability to customize the shelf to my specific needs, I can easily accommodate books, decor, or even small board games, maximizing the table's storage potential and ensuring everything has its place. But perhaps the most impressive aspect of this coffee table is its durability. Despite being subjected to the rigors of a move, it held up beautifully, with no signs of wear or damage. Its sturdy construction has proven to be truly resilient, making it a reliable piece of furniture that I can count on for years to come. In conclusion, this coffee table is a stylish and functional addition to any home. With its clever design, ample storage options, and exceptional durability, it's a piece of furniture that not only enhances your living space but also stands the test of time—even through a move.

It was very easy to assemble and didn’t take too long to assemble, about an hour with two people that weren’t in a rush. For only $90, it looks pretty nice and the rattan makes it look more expensive than it is. My ONLY CON/NEGATIVE is thay the top plywood where the TV rests curves with the TV weighing on it. It’s not too TOO noticeable but you can see the slight curve in the middle if you stare. But for $90, I’m not sweating about it. Maybe adding our TV’s feet/legs will alleviate this issue.

Fairly easy to put together however the “boho” facade on the front is attached with spray adhesive. The Florida heat had caused the adhesive to release & required some repair. It was an easy fix so the piece is still worth the price. I love the aesthetic for a boho beach guest room. I wouldn’t sit on this but it’s a great TV stand.

This is a good size and nice bin I put at my front door entrance to hold our shoes. It’s easy to set up, all you do is unbox it and it opens up like an under storage box. Definitely worth your money and gives a nice neat look. I plan on buying another one but a bigger size to hold my kids toys. 10/10 would recommend:) Read more Kelsey A 5.0 out of 5 stars Nice quality/easy to build Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024 For $40!!

Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024 Color: Dark Blue Size: 43''W Verified Purchase I bought this ottoman as an attractive option for hiding toys, blankets and everything else that ends up on my living room floor..and it delivered plus some. It's big enough to store a bunch of my kiddos' toys, blankets, or even some of those bulky winter clothes that just take up so much space. And let me tell you, having that extra storage has been a blessing for keeping the living room from looking like a toy bomb exploded. Now, besides being this magic box that swallows clutter, it's also pretty sturdy. I've sat on it more times than I can count, and it's held up like a champ, making it a nice little spot to plop down and have a coffee break. The kids also use it as a makeshift stage for their performances, and it's survived, so that's saying something. The fact that it folds is pretty neat too. I mean, I haven't had to fold it away yet because it's constantly in use, but it's nice to know that if we ever needed to, we could easily tuck it away. Plus, assembling it was a piece of cake, which is always a huge plus because who has the time for complicated setups, right? However, it's not all rainbows and butterflies. The material isn't the most luxurious; it's more on the practical side. So if you're looking for something that screams "elegance" and "high-end," this might not hit the mark. Also, because it's so functional and useful, it tends to become a bit of a catch-all. Sometimes, it feels like I'm constantly fishing things out of it or reminding the kids not to just shove everything in there. But honestly, for the price and the sheer utility of it, those cons are pretty minor. It's kind of become a must-have for me in keeping a semblance of order with the chaos of kids running around. So yeah, big thumbs up from this mom! Read more 38 people found this helpful Helpful Report Shoppers 4.0 out of 5 stars Great Storage Solution with a Stylish Look! Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024 Color: Dark Gray Size: 30''W Verified Purchase The SONGMICS 30-Inch Folding Storage Ottoman Bench has been a wonderful addition to my living room. It offers plenty of storage space for blankets, pillows, and other items, which helps keep things tidy. The fact that it folds up is a bonus—it’s perfect for smaller spaces or for someone who needs versatile storage solutions. The bench looks sleek and stylish, and it also functions well as a footrest or extra seating when guests come over. It feels sturdy, and I’m impressed by how much it can hold without losing its shape. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the padding on the top could be a bit thicker for more comfort when sitting on it for extended periods. Other than that, it’s a great buy for the price! Practical, functional, and looks great!

So versatile and comfortable (enough) I was doing a living room update and wanted to keep things in budget. Furniture is absolutely ridiculously priced these days, ahem *joybird* cough cough...I didn't need hand crafted artisinal pieces from finland or something...-Now, this is not a super beautiful piece... It's not going to win any awards.But it's cheap and versatile so it fit my needs and standards.-I replaced the wheels with heavy duty casters that swivel so I could push the ottoman around with relative easy... The wheels that came with it for the pull-out part are static wheels to pull the piece straight in and out... I don't use the pull out too often but I do appreciate that it's there if someone comes to visit and we watch a film or tv show etc, I want them to be able to relax and pull the bed portion out if they want to.-Since I do use it as an ottoman, I did not install the back piece. I don't really mind the black portion but if you have kids the two metal slots for the backpiece can be sharp if bumped into.... So just a word of warning if you also do not want to use the backpiece.Adding a back piece kinda defeats the purpose of an ottoman in my opinion... but to each their own.-The fabric is funky but cool enough that it fits in my room. I have a the FlutterBy multi-color rug by Ruggable and the color of blue works perfectly without being too matchy matchy... It also looks great next to my tan leather couch and pink velvet loveseat/chair...I've used it to read on and like the adjustable back... I could probably sleep on it if I really had to but I haven't napped on it really. It's cozy enough to lay on though.-Attached photos of the pull out portion along with the wheels I installed that were like $8 for 4.Worth the upgrade for how I use the piece.For the price, what are you waiting for!?

Mary Lou McBride 5.0 out of 5 stars Convertible chair to bed Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024 Color: Light Blue Verified Purchase The order arrived ahead of time which was a nice surprise. It was very easy to assemble and exceeds our expectations. Perfect chair for reading and comfortable and spacious as a bed for granddaughter’s sleepovers. Great value for the price and the upholstery is a pretty color and texture.  Almost effortless to convert from chair to bed and bed to chair.

It’s practical because it can be an ottoman or a day bed in an office. It’s small enough but large enough to sleep in comfortably. This is my favorite purchase of 2024!! I’ll be buying another one for the master bedroom. I’m so so happy with this!!! Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report Freeze Dat! 4.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024 Color: Light Blue Verified Purchase This sleeper sofa  is a great space-saving option for small apartments, dorm rooms or home offices. While it performs well as a compact loveseat or ottoman during the day, it easily folds out to a single bed for overnight guests. The light blue upholstery has a modern, clean-lined look that will fit into most decor styles. It also has adjustable backrests and armrests for customizable comfort while seating two. As with many futon-style couch beds, this one is quite firm and not the most cushiony seat. However, for the price and versatility in a tight space, it's difficult to beat. The fold-out mattress is comfortable enough for one person to sleep on. Overall, this 4-in-1 futon couch/ottoman/loveseat  is a practical furniture piece that saves space without compromising functionality. Its transformable design makes it suitable for small living quarters like apartments, dorms or home offices.

Very heavy when it arrived but overall, great quality fabric, sturdy, & very easy to assemble. I would recommend using a power drill to attach wheels. There are guide marking & some starter holes but they are sort of misleading. Best option is to use your better judgment & use a drill for all 4 holes.

I always try things before I ask my guests to sleep on them. I had to get up in the middle of the night and go back to my normal bed because this was so hard. I then bought a foam pad to see if that helped. It did not. It is a rock. Maybe you could nap for 10 mins, but definitely don't expect to be able to sleep on it. Maybe little kids can because they can sleep on a pile of legos, but normal human adults cannot.  I tried to return it, but got a ton of pushback, offered to drop it at the place they told me to ship it to and they said I could not do that; that I had to ship it, even though it's only a few miles away.  Eventually agreed to get $50 off the cost, but I don't think I ever got that credit, so I'm gathering the energy to try and at least get that promised credit. Really think twice about this. I did end up buying a nice little fold out pad that just lays on the floor and is actually comfortable (I tried it).  Bummer because it looks like a good idea.

See dog for scale. Can fit a large man or anyone smaller. Easy to assemble and rolls well. Now if you have carpet, add some carpet slider discs to the bottom legs and make your life easier. Pulls out nicely as well. I haven’t slept on it so that update later. The wheels are a little bit of hassle to install. Definitely use a power drill. By hand with screw driver they include is tiresome.

I love this table! Assembly was easy, the table is very sturdy, and does not bounce when sewing at high speeds (If you sew, you know what I mean). It is the perfect height for me, and I do not have to worry about it holding the weight of a vintage sewing machine. I also love that it folds away when not needed, and is small enough to take on car trips. I plan to buy another soon.

With limited space, I wanted something versatile that wouldn’t dominate my living area. 2. DID IT SOLVE THE PROBLEM? Yes, the WOHOMO Folding Computer Desk solved my problem perfectly! Its foldable design makes it ideal for small spaces, allowing me to quickly set up a workstation and then tuck it away when I’m done working. 3. SPACE-SAVING DESIGN: This desk’s foldable design is a lifesaver in a tight living space. It folds completely flat, allowing me to store it under my bed or against a wall without taking up much room. It’s perfect for people who need flexibility in their home office setup. 4. EASY ASSEMBLY: Assembly was a breeze. It took me less than 10 minutes to set it up right out of the box, and it doesn’t require any tools. Simply unfold the legs, and it’s ready to use. It’s as easy as it gets for a desk! 5. DURABILITY AND BUILD: The rustic walnut finish adds a touch of elegance and fits well with any decor. Despite its lightweight nature, the desk is quite sturdy and has held up well under the weight of my laptop, monitor, and a few desk accessories. It doesn’t wobble, which is crucial when I’m typing away. 6. FUNCTIONALITY: At 31.5 inches, this desk is spacious enough for a laptop and other essentials, making it perfect for writing, working on projects, or even as a study desk for students. It’s the right size for a small room or even a nook in your living area. 7. PORTABILITY: One of the highlights of this desk is its portability. I can easily move it from my living room to my bedroom or anywhere else in the apartment, thanks to its lightweight design. It’s great for someone like me who loves rearranging furniture frequently. 8. FINAL THOUGHTS: The WOHOMO Folding Computer Desk is a practical and stylish solution for anyone dealing with limited space. Its ease of use, compact design, and sturdy build make it a must-have for small apartments or dorm rooms. If you’re looking for a functional yet space-saving desk, I highly recommend this one!

Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024 Size: Small Size:31.5 x 15.7 Color: Beige Verified Purchase I had been looking at small desks for a few months, and the positive reviews on this one made me give it a try. This has been an ideal purchase. I set it up with ease, can carry it around by myself, and it looks nice in the space. It is just a bit wider than the window it is in front of. I now have a perfect WFH space in a guest room and can put it away when we actually have guests. The measurements are accurate, the desk is stable, and I am glad I looked around first and chose this one. Worth every penny!

It assembles easily--you screw a few pieces of metal together--and it's quite sturdy. I love that it collapses easily. You can fit a laptop (mine is 16"), mouse pad, paper, and a coffee mug. The hook is good for cords, bags, and accessories. I'm so satisfied with this collapsible desk.

Second time around desk arrived in perfect condition.  Perfect size for my small space. Fits my laptop, monitor and mouse pad.

Requested a refund and a new be sent. Now I have to get this to a UPS store. Hopefully #2 won’t be broken and I can submit a better review. I got the gray one with gold marble look, it was really pretty. Read more KDL 5.0 out of 5 stars Arrived broken, second one worked out great Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024 Update!

The brackets that hold the shelves, our level according to my level. But the shelves themselves once slid onto the bracket, do not appear level. The shelves also angle slightly forward. Not as happy as I hoped to be!All the hard work is included, directions are included, and fairly easy to hang. They just don't appear completely level.

UPDATE: GREAT customer service Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024 Color: Black Size: 16 Inches Verified Purchase UPDATE: Excellect service. I recived an email that was very well written and got a full refund for both my shelfs. They even wanted to know what ended up working so they can approve. Like I said in my original review the only issue was the anchor. i got two packs of these cause it was a great deal. The shelf itself is nice, and the steel rod is nice too, but the anchors are horrible. I put it in my wall and the shelf was straight and tilted towards me and extremely wobbly. I went and got new anchors and attempted to take out the old ones. they would not come out and i had to rip them out and it made a deep and biggish hole. 4. so, i had to patch them up. its past the return, bummed cause i like the look but its been a PAIN to put these shelves up. A simple project has turned into a headache. If you get these don’t use the anchor it came with, new anchors will be better. once again, the look itself is great, anchors are a HUGE downfall.

Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2024 Color: Black Size: 16 Inches Verified Purchase I love these shelves. They are so secure and there is no wiggle to them. They are very lightweight and an amazing value for your money. They can hold a decent amount of weight and also they can be lopsided. You can have something heavy and then something light on different size and it doesn’t seem to tilt. I’ve had them for three months and they hold perfect.

Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024 Color: Black Size: 16 Inches Verified Purchase The shelves are nice and easy to install. Exactly what you would expect. The only thing I would recommend is to replace the wall anchors that they come with. Get sturdier, higher quality wall anchors. I originally used the ones that came with the package and the shelves could bear significantly less weight than advertised... any amount of weight had them sagging out from the wall. If you use quality wall anchors and don't put anything too heavy on them, these shelves will serve you well.

The box included all pieces and the directions were easy to follow.  The product was easy to assemble and pieces were individually labeled.  There  netting on the bottom took a little time to figure out how exactly to thread the string to hold it in place. The cage itself stands around 5 feet tall and holds a lot of animals. If you have small children you may want to use an anchor string to prevent this product from tipping over. It is not heavy but is very easy to push over.

My boys (8,6) even helped me build it. Came with instructions and it was easy to read. Took me about 20mins. The height of it is about 5’1” and holds more than enough toys/plushies.

Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023 Color: Light Grey Verified Purchase I first purchased the DEVAISE 3 a few weeks ago, and was so happy with it that I decided to also buy the singe-tower DEVAISE 2. As good as the assembly and product hardare were with the “3” model, the “2” was even better (better bag labeling, with extra screws, etc. in the event of a mishap or missing piece). The quality for all of the components is very good and everything was conscientiously labeled and accounted for. I’ve bought my share of self-assembly tables and file cabs over the years, including a ton of Ikea products, for home and business, but I must say that this line is hands down the most impressive I’ve seen to date. Both tables were smartly packaged to avoid shipping damage, and promptly delivered with Amazon Prime. More importantly, the directions were accurate and relatively easy to follow. At 75 years, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, but the quality of printing allowed me to double-check myself with a magnifying glass. As with many off-shore assembly guides, the text and written instructions were minimal, but the illustrations alone were clear and fairly easy to follow. Assembly took about an hour, slightly less on the smaller “2”. A couple of simple tools were provided, but as I have carpal tunnel, I used an electric screwdriver on several of the assembly steps to be able to tighten the various nuts and bolts appropriately. I also used a couple of regular screwdrivers. The engineering of these units is simple, efficient and well...to use that word again...smart. The finished tables are quite sturdy for home office use, as intended. These folks know what they are doing. I did manage to over-tighten a couple of shelf screws on the “2”, slightly cracking on shelf. Just enough to reach out to their support, and I will update this post with the results. Lightweight, study, attractive and relatively easy to assemble. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this line of home-office tables and file cabinets!

Sill, those materials make it lightweight and easy to move around. Plywood top sturdy enough for all-in-one printer/copier.  The file drawer seems adequate for light, hanging file home use, but it probably wouldn't hold up to office type stuffed files. This is a typical Chinese flat box furniture do it yourself in "13 steps" project with the usual flimsy tools and not much in the way of English instructions.  However, the pictures are pretty good for Chinese instructions, with a couple of expanded view inserts. Also, you get extra screws and nuts for the very real possibility of dropping and losing one of the small pieces.  Unless you have size extra small hands, putting the sliders on the drawers will require a pair of pliers to hold the very small fasteners.  Overall though, assembly is not bad for a Chinese flat box project, and one should be able to get it done in 1-3 hours, depending on experience with similar items.

I have a small corner desk and neither of my dual monitors can be heightened leading to some neck issues. I needed a solution to increase my monitor height while also providing additional organization space for my small home office. This product filled both needs. My monitors are now a little above eye level, and the space underneath provides more storage space. I like the phone tray on each, for my phone or whichever pen I'm using at the moment. Definitely recommend.

Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase This monitor stand accomplished all I needed it to. It elevates my monitor for more comfort, provides extra storage space on top as well as below, and is moveable which allows for better organization on my desk. The side sections can be installed so that they pivot or can be pulled out and pushed in. It was quick and easy to put together and is lightweight. Read more Helpful Report Crystal Thompson 5.0 out of 5 stars Does it for me! Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase I needed something to lift these screens up to eye level. With my monitor and laptop just sitting on the table alone, my posture was suffering. When looking down at the screens, It's like my body involuntarily wants to lean in closer to them, thus causing me to have that unsightly hump in my back. That's a no go! Even with looking at the measurements of the stands before buying them, i wasn't sure if three inches lifted off the table would be enough. I was pleasantly surprised once assembled. It was just enough to keep me from leaning forward. I think the nice little storage spaces underneath are nice too. Turned my table into a nice little workstation :) Assembly was easy, took about 20 -30 mins. May even take you less time honestly. Not much to put together. I saw in a review of the wood cracking where you are to screw the pieces together. That person must have really put a lot of force into over tightening because the individual pieces are tough. Don't over tighten and you should not have any problems. Functionality- As i said before, it puts the screens at eye level for me. I guess this also depends on the height of your own desk/table, your height, and the height of your chair. There's also the two swivel pieces that are to enable the swivel function should you choose to install them. I preferred not to install them as installing them will limit how far you can adjust the length of the stands. Not installing them has not diminished the integrity of the stands in any way and they can still "swivel". It's sturdy so far and i don't see it falling apart anytime soon. I included a picture using one of the slots for an ipad so you can see how it looks but i haven't used it for that until writing this review. I'd recommend. Inexpensive. Easy to assembly. Does not feel cheap. Does what it advertises. No more hunchback for me! Read more Crystal Thompson 5.0 out of 5 stars Does it for me!

Images in this review Helpful Report Laura G 5.0 out of 5 stars Raised my monitors and organized my desk Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase I bought this because I liked the idea of not only getting my monitors to a better height, but because it offered storage. I have a set up that lets me switch from my work laptop to my personal tower-style PC using the same monitors (I use an HDMI 4x2 switch to save me from having to crawl under the desk). When I'm working, my personal keyboard and mouse can be tucked away neatly but still accessible if I want to game on my lunch or right after work. There's space for my HDMI switch and more counter space for my calendar, phone charger, etc. My cables are out of sight and out of my way. I like how much this raises my monitors. One is pretty old and doesn't go up and down anymore and it's nice to only need one dictionary instead of a pile of them. I work hybrid and use my own monitors to extend my work computer. When I'm not working, I use the same monitors for my personal computer. The space underneath allows me to store the peripherals for whichever computer I'm not using along with my HDMI 4x2 switch, my glasses, and other bits and bobs that would take up space on my desk. I like the rail for my phone (though it doesn't fit my iPad) and the extra counter space for my calendar, soundbar and clock. It was easy to assemble (think a really small IKEA book shelf) and I like the stability of the metal pegs keeping the three platforms together. If you have a smaller space, you won't be able to use the pegs, but it still feels very solid. Much more solid than books piled up to raise my monitor.

The stand was extremely easy to assemble with only needing a Phillips wrench. I was surprised with how much space there is under the lofted shelves to allow extra storage, I have de-cluttered my desk and have storage in bins under the elevated shelf’s (side pieces) that are roughly 3 inches (not part of the shelving package). Quality is great, and the color matches the image (black wood finish). Highly highly recommend this monitor stand, there is less strain on my neck since I purchased this for my dual monitors.

The height if this stand is perfect makes 8 hours of viewing much more comfortable. Assembly went smoothly until I noticed that one of the holes for the dowels was not cut. It was, however, marked so it was east to drill. The last and most unfortunate miss on this setup is that both of the monitor stand portions have the slot for the tablet/phone holder on the same side, so I cam only use holder. I decided to keep because the holder is the only real issue, but it is disappointing.

It is sturdy enough and bit bulky than expected. Gives me the full view of additional screens without my laptop screen coming in between. Instructions were fair enough except for the fact that few holes doesn't come with thred and as per instructions in can get confused if we're doing it right. But just follow the instructions with images without a second thought and it should be fine Read more Amal Mohan 5.0 out of 5 stars Good addition to my work from home setup Reviewed in Canada on April 22, 2024 I was initially planning to buy a different table with adjustable monitor stands but I'm glad I chose this stand instead.

I need to tell you something about me.  I am 93 years old.  It was a challenge to assemble, and I managed to get the top half done and I assembled the bottom half as well. However, I have a painful back so I couldn’t lift the top onto the bottom without assistance from a friend.  He lifted the desk onto the frame and it was a joy to realize that I actually did it!  Now I have a few Suggs for the manufacturer:  The storage on the right will dump all the contents onto the floor when the table is lifted to a slope.  One needs to remove all the contents first and when adjusting the slope, one must lift the entire table all the way to full extent, then lowere it down to where you need it.  I also find the small shelf/basket under the desk is pretty useless because one needs to lean way down or stand on one’s head in order to see what is on the shelf.  Other than these issues, I am very glad I purchased the desk.  I use it for painting watercolors and now have a place to work and not have to use my dining table.  I think it is very well designed and is very sturdy.  I like the side extension on the left to put my pallet and instead of lifting the top up and down, I use a small easel ifI want to put my drawing board at an angle.  I am very glad that I purchased this product.

Unfortunately, I am missing item 33 and Amazon cannot send replacement parts . Read more Helpful Report Customer Review 5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for Diamond Painting & Paint by Number Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024 Color: Clear/Grey Verified Purchase Very happy with this drafting table. I use it mainly for diamond painting and paint by number. It’s great for painting because the top is glass and any paint can be easily washed or scraped off without damaging the tabletop. My diamond painting light pad also likes the glass surface as well and the non slip feet stay firmly in place even when tilted fairly steep. I don't use the drawers because for my needs, I have a roller drawer bin that I pull up right next to me with most of my supplies inside and the drawers were not going to be able to hold all my stuff. I also found that the drawers were more in the way of my legs and chair, prohibiting me from being seated in the middle of the table so I removed them completely. I like the side holders but I only installed them on the right side- Im right handed- and its perfect for holding tweezers, scissors, washi tape and brushes but I left it off the left side so I can use my clip light along that side easier- the bracket just gets in the way otherwise. I use mine in my dining room and I appreciate it having wheels so I can move it easily to another room when we have company. The tilt function is easy to use although unless Im doing something wrong, needs to be tilted all the way up in order to put it back down to start over. When you have work already attached to the table and tools in the side pocket, that is not an ideal situation. Not a deal breaker but more of an inconvenience. I use this table for hours at a time and it is one of my two best purchases for my crafting needs. Assembly was fairly quick and easy but make certain you pay attention to which way the front is facing in instructions so the sides are correct since one is different than the other due to the drawers. Also don't fully tighten the screws until the end, have some play, otherwise it can end up wonky and more difficult to assemble.  I did have some trouble getting all the screws through when putting on the glass top but I managed to get them all in. Theres a little foam pad on the underside to protect the glass but it blocks the screw hole ( some we not pre poked open & the screws didn't know where to go ) so I used a sharp screw to poke the holes open from underneath and then used the machine screws that came with the table to complete the attachment. Overall very happy with this table and would absolutely purchase from them again.

Amazon Customer 5.0 out of 5 stars I love my new desk Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024 Color: Rustic Size: 47 inch Verified Purchase As an avid crafter and someone who spends considerable time at my computer, finding the right desk is crucial for both comfort and functionality. The MINOSYS Gaming/Computer Desk caught my eye with its unique design, compact size, and promise of versatility. Here's my review: Design and Style: The MINOSYS desk boasts a rustic charm that sets it apart from traditional gaming or computer desks. Its sleek yet minimalist design fits well in a variety of room settings, adding a touch of sophistication to any space. The addition of a monitor stand not only elevates the aesthetic appeal but also provides ergonomic benefits by ensuring the screen is at eye level, reducing neck strain during long gaming or work sessions. Despite its compact size, this desk offers ample surface area for my paints, brushes, goops, sprays and other accessories. The desk features a sturdy construction that can support the weight of multiple projects or vigorous crafting without wobbling or instability. Assembly of the desk was straightforward, thanks to clear instructions and well-labeled parts. The quality of materials used is evident, with durable construction that feels solid and reliable. The desk's rustic finish adds character while providing resistance to scratches and wear, ensuring long-lasting durability even with regular use. In my opinion the MINOSYS Gaming/Computer Desk is a stylish and functional addition to any crafting workspace. Its compact size make it a versatile option for gamers, students, or professionals alike. Its simplicity, durability, and ergonomic benefits make it a worthy investment for anyone in need of a reliable and attractive workstation.

Images in this review Helpful Report Jeffrey Watson 4.0 out of 5 stars Nice little desk for bedroom. Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024 Verified Purchase This desk was easy to assemble and looks very nice. The shelf is a great addition so that your computer is not on the floor and it does not take up any desktop space. (I have it on the left side of the desk) That shelf and the monitor riser are pretty sturdy. The monitor riser is holding 2 24' monitors without any issue. The only thing that I personally dont like about this desk is that the right side (without shelf) seems a bit flimsy. The front right leg seems to stretch out from its mounting if the desk is bumped or moved. I have confirmed that the bolts mounting it are tight. Other than this small issue, the desk holds up and looks great. Still a great value for money!

It features a sleek, modern design and is made from high-quality, durable materials with a smooth, easy-to-clean surface. The desk offers ample storage options, including deep drawers, spacious shelves, and a dedicated printer space, making it easy to keep everything organized. Its height is comfortable, with plenty of legroom and an ergonomic keyboard tray, perfect for long study sessions. Assembly was straightforward with clear instructions. Overall, this desk provides excellent value for money and is highly recommended for anyone needing a functional and stylish study and storage solution. Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report Howie Rodman 5.0 out of 5 stars High Marks Across the Board Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024 Verified Purchase Took about an hour-ish to assemble.  Instructions are limited with the exception of the pictures.  They actually do the trick alone.  But pay attention to which holes are where as they WILL dictate if you'll be taking pieces apart to fix later....(why it took me an hour+).  That's where the pictures really help, but only if you're paying attention to them. But nice material, holds together very sturdy.  Nice and compact.  It comes with everything you need to assemble.....a screwdriver (phillips and flathead screw driver comes with it).  All the parts are labeled (nuts & bolts are bagged separately and labeled).  I was really impressed for the price. Read more 6 people found this helpful Helpful Report M.L. Kirby 5.0 out of 5 stars Works for my needs Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024 Color: Rustic Size: 39 inch Verified Purchase Easy to put together, and versatile set up for your situation. This is a real nice look for faux rustic wood. Instructions are made for men with pictures, sorry guys most people like to read for more comprehension with pictures. I didn't use the top monitor shelf for economic reasons of having the computer to high for bifocals. The instructions didn't provide the option for putting the monitor shelf at the bottom as pictured on the website pictures but I figured it out.  I have a tall and wide computer tower so I couldn't use the side middle shelf. It could use a keyboard shelf under the table top for ergonomic comfort. I took advantage of the extra screw holes on the legs and purchase some lumber to make another shelf under the table top for placing other equipment. I also purchased a sliding keyboard shelf to attach to the table top but I had to get a 20 inch keyboard shelf so beware that large keyboards will not leave room for a mouse. I will post pictures later after my shelf has been stained and attached if this lets me. It is stable for a non- solid wood product.

I love the color and it's very, very inexpensive, but very durable. It fits right into the space I wanted. It is sturdy and durable.

Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024 Color: Pink Size: 47 inch Verified Purchase This desk is very good quality for the price. I bought one for my girlfriend and she loved it so much we bought another one for me to use. It’s a very sturdy desk that’s not too heavy and it’s perfect for our PC’s. You can add an extra shelf to the desk if you want or leave it out for a nice slot for your PC to fit.

Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 10, 2024 Verified Purchase I do like it. For the price you cannot complain. It took me around 30 min to build it without really looking at the instructions. The tools needed were provided. Basically a star screwdriver but I used my drill for convenience. The side part of the desk where you would put your computer tower is big enough . My computer tower is on the larger size. It fits all the way in but as you can see in the image I have it sitting out this is mostly so I can access the USB ports on top. The little shelf for not get fixed into place but it sits there very sturdy as you can my screen is sitting up on it and I feel confident it won't move. I actually like that it is not fixed as I can reposition it anywhere in the desk should I relocate the desk. There is a bit of creeking and bending when you lean on the center of the desk. It's not a solid rigid desk. I mean you wouldn't ever find yourself thinking I can climb up on it too reach something. But its perfectly fine for leaning on for the low price is sleek trendy and tidy. Doesn't take up a lot of space. Read more William, Belfast. 5.0 out of 5 stars Very smart looking desk.

Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023 Color: Light Grey Verified Purchase I first purchased the DEVAISE 3 a few weeks ago, and was so happy with it that I decided to also buy the singe-tower DEVAISE 2. As good as the assembly and product hardare were with the “3” model, the “2” was even better (better bag labeling, with extra screws, etc. in the event of a mishap or missing piece). The quality for all of the components is very good and everything was conscientiously labeled and accounted for. I’ve bought my share of self-assembly tables and file cabs over the years, including a ton of Ikea products, for home and business, but I must say that this line is hands down the most impressive I’ve seen to date. Both tables were smartly packaged to avoid shipping damage, and promptly delivered with Amazon Prime. More importantly, the directions were accurate and relatively easy to follow. At 75 years, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, but the quality of printing allowed me to double-check myself with a magnifying glass. As with many off-shore assembly guides, the text and written instructions were minimal, but the illustrations alone were clear and fairly easy to follow. Assembly took about an hour, slightly less on the smaller “2”. A couple of simple tools were provided, but as I have carpal tunnel, I used an electric screwdriver on several of the assembly steps to be able to tighten the various nuts and bolts appropriately. I also used a couple of regular screwdrivers. The engineering of these units is simple, efficient and well...to use that word again...smart. The finished tables are quite sturdy for home office use, as intended. These folks know what they are doing. I did manage to over-tighten a couple of shelf screws on the “2”, slightly cracking on shelf. Just enough to reach out to their support, and I will update this post with the results. Lightweight, study, attractive and relatively easy to assemble. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this line of home-office tables and file cabinets!

Sill, those materials make it lightweight and easy to move around. Plywood top sturdy enough for all-in-one printer/copier.  The file drawer seems adequate for light, hanging file home use, but it probably wouldn't hold up to office type stuffed files. This is a typical Chinese flat box furniture do it yourself in "13 steps" project with the usual flimsy tools and not much in the way of English instructions.  However, the pictures are pretty good for Chinese instructions, with a couple of expanded view inserts. Also, you get extra screws and nuts for the very real possibility of dropping and losing one of the small pieces.  Unless you have size extra small hands, putting the sliders on the drawers will require a pair of pliers to hold the very small fasteners.  Overall though, assembly is not bad for a Chinese flat box project, and one should be able to get it done in 1-3 hours, depending on experience with similar items.

It's of good quality for the price. There were no damages, and all parts were included, making it easy to assemble. With hand tools, it should take about 1-2 hours, depending on your handiness—possibly less. The bed does make a little noise with rough movement, but it's nothing excessive.

Anik Datta 5.0 out of 5 stars Adds a modern touch while providing a comfortable backrest Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024 Color: Dark Grey Size: Queen Style: Modern Verified Purchase The Allewie Upholstered Queen Size Platform Bed Frame with 4 Storage Drawers is an outstanding choice for anyone seeking both style and practicality in their bedroom.

Read more 7 people found this helpful Helpful Report Amazon Customer 5.0 out of 5 stars Pleasantly surprise for the price! Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024 Color: Light Grey Size: Queen Style: Modern Verified Purchase I've put together a lot of furniture over the years.  This bed is sturdy!  The parts were good quality and the instructions easy to follow.  It only takes a single included allen wrench to assemble.  The wrench could be better to ease assembly but its a one time use and then thrown away.  The fit and finish is good.  While the headboard isn't grand or plush, it simple and elegant.  Once completely assembled the bed is sturdy.  At first the wood slats seem undersized, but once the mattress is on I couldn't tell.  It would take an adult to jump up and down on the mattress to possibly break it.  Don't plan on putting heavy items in the drawers as they are wire baskets on wheels.  They are great for winter clothes, wrapping paper, spare linens etc..  I'm using this bed in a guest room.  It would be great for kids/teen bedrooms and if your on a budget the master bedroom.  5 for sturdiness, style, and assembly.  4 on the drawers.  This is a post assembly review, not a long term review.

We've wanted a bed like this for a long time, but were hoping we'd find one that wasn't a platform bed. We couldn't pass up the deal on this, so went ahead and ordered it. Installation wasn't hard at all. The bed is very sturdy and eye appealing. My main downfall is the drawers. They seem very flimsy and get stuck...a lot. Other than that, great bed! Read more 5 people found this helpful Helpful Report Natasha A Kurtz 5.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality, Very Happy Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024 Color: Light Grey Size: Queen Style: Antique Verified Purchase Assembled and started using this a few days ago, and I'm so happy with it. The frame itself is super sturdy and stable, all metal pieces and thick screws/bolts, with very precise dimensions not allowing it to wiggle around at all, so it's squeak-free so far. Every piece was labeled and the instructions pamphlet was easy to follow, with all the screws and other tiny pieces very well-packaged and labeled as well. The cloth on the headboard, footboard and draws is soft and decent quality. The gray is bit better-looking in person than in the photos, it should be pretty versatile to work with your decor. Pros: - very solid, sturdy - easy-ish assembly (lot of steps, but easy-to-follow instructions) - very, very high quality for the price - great engineering Cons: - it's super heavy when assembled, you will likely have to disassemble it to move it to another home - the wooden support slats use thick plastic pegs instead of bolts to attach to the frame; the pegs may dry-rot over time and need to be replaced with bolts Summary: I'm super happy with this purchase, and honestly think it will be worth the disassembly and reassembly for our next move. If it suits your fashion, I highly recommend.

Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024 Color: Dark Grey Size: King Style: Modern Verified Purchase I recently upgraded to the Allewie Upholstered King Size Platform Bed Frame with 4 Storage Drawers and Headboard, and it has exceeded all expectations, earning a solid 5-star rating. This bed frame seamlessly blends style with functionality, providing a luxurious sleeping space with added storage convenience. Design and Construction: The upholstered headboard adds a touch of sophistication, creating a focal point in the bedroom. The neutral color complements various decor styles, allowing for easy integration into any room. The quality of the upholstery is evident, providing both comfort and durability. Storage Drawers: The four spacious storage drawers integrated into the bed frame are a game-changer for those seeking additional space in the bedroom. These drawers effortlessly slide in and out, offering a discreet and organized solution for storing extra linens, clothing, or personal items. The design ensures that the drawers are seamlessly integrated, maintaining the overall aesthetic appeal of the bed. Sturdiness and Support: The platform design eliminates the need for a box spring, providing excellent support for the mattress. The construction is robust, and the bed frame feels solid and secure. Even with the added storage drawers, there is no compromise on stability. Easy Assembly: One notable feature is the straightforward assembly process. The instructions are clear, and all necessary tools are provided. The bed frame came together seamlessly, and I appreciated the attention to detail in the assembly instructions. Overall Comfort: Beyond its practical features, the Allewie bed frame offers a comfortable and inviting sleeping space. The padded headboard provides a supportive surface for sitting up and reading or watching TV. In conclusion, the Allewie Upholstered King Size Platform Bed Frame has transformed my bedroom into a stylish and organized sanctuary. It's a perfect blend of elegance and practicality, and the added storage drawers are a true asset. If you're in search of a high-quality, functional, and aesthetically pleasing bed frame, look no further. Highly recommended!

(With a few minor cosmetic issues) I only docked one star because of the cosmetic issues as it was fresh out of the box and already had some paint chips and a small dent on the underside of the desktop. These are very minor, and arent really visible once all assembled, but still kind of upsetting for it being a brand new deskThe instructions were very easy to read, except for one part, where it says to rotate clockwise to make the right leg go down. If you are following the orientation shown in the drawing, you should turn counter clockwise to make the left leg go down. It was easy to figure out, so no biggie. Aside from that, everything was very clear and there were even extras of each screw included! The steps and images are simple and clear.The mechanism works wonderfully, granted it has only been 1 hour since I have started using it. As far as noise goes, it kind of sounds like if your neighbor was vaccuming. So its not noisy at all, but also not completely silent. You wouldnt be bothering your roommate in the next bedroom, but might annoy someone you are sharing a bedroom with.The presets are easy to set.Something to note is that the table for the motor is attached to the motor. Seems like common sense, but I spent 10 minutes looking for this extra cable until I realized its already on the motor, and thats why it wasnt in the "included" list haha.I got the 48" white table for $110. It was delivered by FedEx and they rang my doorbell and dropped it off at my door for me! I was surprised since my entrance is kind of off to the side of my building and most people leave packages at the normal entrance - and i have to go outside and around to get them. I also had injured my foot recently, so this was really convinient. isnt something Amazon related, but compliments to the FedEx worker and props to the company for using FedEx to deliver their products!The table top feels durable.  I might cover it with a curtain just because im very particular about white things getting stained. Overall, for $110, im pleased! I will update my review once I get more time using it.I recommend this moving desk!

Put together by myself in less than an hour. Really easy to use and really easy program the heights. 48in desk is perfect for 2 monitors and my file holder. The top of the desk is two parts but it’s really not noticeable Read more Helpful Report Beckie 5.0 out of 5 stars Practical & Easy Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024 Color: Rust Brown Size: 48*24 Verified Purchase I needed another smaller desk that didn’t take much space but would fit 2 monitors and my laptop. It’s nice looking, easy to put together and sturdy. Fits both monitors and laptop with room to have a keyboard, mouse plus room for a notebook and  other various office supplies. Was easy to program the different heights for sitting or standing. A+ product.

It was super easy to assemble and is nice overall but what I don’t love is that it wobbles/sways a bit.  Not because of the assembly because I feel the base is sturdy, but I think because the thickness is the desktop is thin (I think half inch?). I have 3 monitors with arm mounts and I think the weight of it makes it wobble.  I had the same setup on my 48”w, 1” thick desk and it didn’t budge.  The motor seems good and it has two hooks on either end which I like.

Thought I got the wrong item. My wife convince me to at least open the box and inspect the contents in box; I was glad I listened to my boss. Found it was exactly what I ordered originally. The Electric desk was elegant, flawless and a thing of beauty. Installation was a breeze. The manufacturers labeled the component pieces so discreet that my 12 year old can assemble the desk without any adult assistant. I was so enamored with the SMUG electric desk; I quickly went on Amazon and cancelled the "Return" I started. The ergonomic and aesthetic nature of the desk is impeccable. The price is so affordable and doesn't hurt your budget. Read more 3 people found this helpful Helpful Report Michelle A. 5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome desk! Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024 Color: White Size: 40*24 Verified Purchase Awesome value, great quality, easy to put together. Work so smooth. Heavy duty materials. Well worth the money! Instructions are perfect but you will want to get a screwdriver as the one provided is not strong enough for what you need it for. Very pleased with this purchase. Read more 4 people found this helpful Helpful Report erica reynolds 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect! Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024 Color: White Size: 40*24 Verified Purchase I wanted a standing desk to pair with my walking pad and this one is perfect. It’s heavy duty and the motor to adjust the height makes it easy to do so. Putting it together took me a little while to figure out but was simple enough. I highly recommend a drill for the screws because this thing killed my hangs manually screwing in the short screws with a regular screw driver. This set comes with a screw driver of its own which is a nice touch but it didn’t last through the whole process and became stripped. Rip. Otherwise, after some gnarly grip and wrist workouts I got this put together. It’s HEAVY and well worth the effort so far.

How to adjust uneven legs Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2024 Color: White Size: 48*24 WholePiece Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded. I really like this desk so far! Time will tell how well it holds up, though! I ordered the 48x24 one piece, and the desk table top came in perfect condition with no scratches or cracks. It was straightforward to set up following the instructions. I was surprised by how quiet the desk is when I raise or lower it,  and it moves super smoothly with about 20 lb of weight on it. After setting it up I noticed it was a little uneven, one leg was 1/3' lower than the other, not a big deal but I did one to remedy it. I'm uploading a video of how I evened out the legs in case it helps somebody else. Now the desk is perfectly level and I love it! I did email customer service to ask for the videos another reviewer said they had received which explained how to address the uneven leg situation, I can only upload one video to this review so I'm including my video, but the two short videos the company sent me were not all that helpful. I hope my video for evening out the legs helps somebody! So far so good, I think it's a great desk for the price but I'll update the review down the road if anything comes up. I do advise looking into and buying some sort of cable management product, after a setup I ordered a 15" cable management tray to clean everything up, as the desk does not come with any such thing.

Reviewed in Canada on August 28, 2023 Color: Black Size: 49*24 Verified Purchase I shopped for a very long time before picking this one converter. I work from home most days and didn't want to replace my whole desk. This converter holds my main screen as well as my laptop and laptop stand to use as a second screen. The whole thing is very comfortable, extremely easy to bring up and down, and very sturdy. I've had it for seven months now and it still looks new after near-daily usage. My only complaint is that it only comes in black!

I like the wide seat format that allows me to sit yogi-style crossed-leg. Has a nice swivel and rock. I kinda wish it had wheels but it’s not a big deal that it doesn’t. I got the beige because it was on sale and I like it but of course it isn’t very stain-forgiving. I work at our dining table and have two babies under two so, it was expected that we would have to deal with stains. Had the darker colors been on sale, I would have gone with one of those. I will definitely order again when the time comes. For now, it is holding up very well and is sturdy enough to hold a larger person. Easily adjustable and a very good value. I sit with it in the upright locked position but it does recline nicely. My husband put it together for me, he said it was easy to assemble.

Webster 4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable but LOUD Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024 Verified Purchase This chair is fabulous. It is comfortable, fairly easy to assemble, and looks great. I love that it is wide enough to accommodate my fluff, and that I can easily sit cross-legged or in different positions. That said, it sounds like a freight train every time you move. If you work from home and can mute yourself on calls, it's fine, but if you have a shared office, be prepared for colleague retaliation. Read more Helpful Report Max1013 5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE it! Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024 Color: Beige Style: Classic Verified Purchase I really LOVE this chair. I can comfortable sit cross-legged while also having a firm support for my back. It is very sturdy, was easy to put together, and super stylish. The only thing I wish it had were wheels because I often move my chair around from classroom to classroom. But, the ability to spin and rock is very nice. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend buying this chair!! Read more Helpful Report Jordie Eason 5.0 out of 5 stars Gets used daily Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2024 Color: Beige Style: Classic Verified Purchase I have ASD1 and have to cross my legs while doing my makeup and this has made it so I am no longer on the floor. The chair is sturdy, I weigh 250 and am 6ft and it’s the most helpful chair I’ve ever owned! Definitely worth the money. It’s super easy to assemble, minimal screws, it reclines when you’re relaxing or reading a book. The chair is beyond comfortable, and the adjustability makes for an amazing purchase. Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report Running 5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for every sitting style Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024 Color: Beige Style: Classic Verified Purchase I’ve bought many chairs, but this one is by far my favorite. It's so big, spacious, and incredibly comfortable. Just like the reviews mentioned, it’s perfect for someone like me who loves to move around and sit cross-legged. No matter what position I sit or squat in, I never feel uncomfortable. It's an absolute winner! The only downside might be that it doesn’t have wheels, but since I prefer the chair to stay in one place most of the time, it actually works out well for me. So, it's not really a problem—just something to consider! Read more Helpful Report annet 5.0 out of 5 stars AMAzing !!!! Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024 Color: Beige Style: Classic Verified Purchase I recently purchased the PUKAMI Criss Cross Chair, an armless cross-legged office desk chair, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The chair is not only aesthetically pleasing with its unique criss-cross design, but it is also very comfortable to sit on for long periods of time. The seat is well-padded and offers great support for my back, allowing me to maintain good posture throughout the day. One of the standout features of this chair is its cross-legged design, which adds stability and style to my office space. The chair is also height-adjustable, allowing me to customize it to my preferred seating position. The PUKAMI Criss Cross Chair is made of high-quality materials, and the construction feels sturdy and durable. The chair is easy to assemble and the instructions provided were clear and concise. Overall, I highly recommend the PUKAMI Criss Cross Chair for anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable office desk chair. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of design, comfort, and durability. Read more 15 people found this helpful Helpful Report onyx1176 3.0 out of 5 stars Chair squeaks and pops and padding not very comfortable Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024 Color: Beige Style: Traditional Verified Purchase There are many criss-cross chairs for sale on Amazon, with prices ranging from reasonable, $70-$80 to unreasonable, $100 or more. When I bought this chair for around $89, it seemed like a good deal compared to similar chairs. However, I have two main issues with the Pukami brand: the padding is quite hard, and the chair squeaks and pops whenever I move. I don't mind firm memory foam padding, but this padding is just plain hard with little give, and the noise comes from where the seat attaches to the gas lift. Another annoying issue is that the adjustable arm under the seat isn't secure. One time over the few days I sat in the chair, the arm slipped out of the locked position, causing the chair to lean back unexpectedly. This function should only activate when the arm is intentionally pulled out. This type of chair is very easy to assemble, and I don't think the issue is due to assembly, so I'm unsure if mine is defective or if this is a common problem with this brand. Despite these issues, it was still much better than the smaller chairs I had been using, so I decided to keep it. However, I needed another chair for my work desk and ended up buying an identical-looking criss-cross chair from another Amazon seller at a cheaper price. While these two chairs look alike, the difference is significant. The new chair has softer fabric, and doesn't squeak or pop when I move. With that said, I decided to give the Pukami chair to a family member and purchased another chair from the other seller for my work desk. I am glad I tried the criss-cross chairs; they are great and, if you pick the right brand, very comfortable and roomy. I highly recommend this style of chair, just not this vendor. In my experience, if you are looking for a chair because your current one is no longer working for you, any criss-cross chair is likely better than what you are currently sitting in.

It hasn't really been used yet (just assembled) but the gas lift works perfectly. Looks exactly like it did in the picture. The seat cushion comes off and appears to have a zipper part to it, which I hope will come in handy and may be easy to wash, as this was purchased for my teenage son who is an absolutely filthy slob in regard to his bedroom.  Love the color. Only took 2 screws, which lines up perfectly. It's on carpet so it isn't too noisy, but I did roll it around the kitchen first and it didn't squeak at all. Upon first inspection, great product for the price!

SolarisGuru 5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive little chair Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024 Color: Pink Verified Purchase I bought the pink version for my seven year old daughter. She loves it. It seems durable enough and for the price it's perfect. It took about five minutes to put it together and most of that time was unboxing and unpacking it. Super simple to assemble, she says it's comfortable, she loves the color, and budget friendly! Definitely not for a large adult though. Perfect for a kid or teenager! Also has a decent range of increasing the height and lowering it. My seven year old is tiny and at its lowest position it's absolutely perfect for her. We will be buying more of these for our other two kids! Thanks for making a great chair and keeping a reasonable price!

Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024 Color: Black Verified Purchase I am pleased with this chair. I have been using it for over a week. Have not seen any wear problems. I use it when working with my computer. It rolls  very smoothly on our carpet. I typically spend 4 or more hours sitting in it each day. I was looking for a chair to sit in for 1-2 hours in at a time. Then get up and walk around. I was not looking for a chair to sit in nonstop all day or sleep in. I previously used a wooden chair, but it didn't have rollers. Sometimes I use this chair without the cushion. I do that when I want to walk around more frequently Seat is less comfortable, but the seat still works fine. I am 6'1", weigh 185 pounds and my pants legs size is 32 inches inseam. The back rest fits my back fine. I can adjust the height to work nicely with my legs. It was easy to assemble.

It has everything you need. It's pretty sturdy, but it is pretty light weight, and probably not meant for heavy duty daily use.  I got this for my 9 yr old son's new desk in his bedroom.  I probably wouldn't recommend getting this for a daily work environment. Perfect for the price.  It's really very cute.  I'll give it a 5 right now.

It arrived earlier than predicted and packaged nicely. It took only minutes to put together. It is the perfect size for my small sewing area and also for my overcrowded office area. Only time and use will tell how well it holds up, but it is much more comfortable than the prehistoric one (bought used from a military equipment auction 40 years ago) that I was using. I will be ordering another one for my office and maybe even one for my vacation home office. I can not give the full 5 stars as I do not know how long it will last, but will update if it lasts longer than the last one I bought for my vacation home office (around a year) which was much more expensive.

Images in this review Helpful Report Jimmy 5.0 out of 5 stars Nice cabinet but takes time to assemble Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023 Color: Shiplap Gray/Pure White Pattern Name: File Cabinet Verified Purchase The directions are fair, there are a lot of parts. I bought two and 1st took 50 minutes to assemble but 2nd took 25. Parts are labeled with  long numbers why not A,B,C and illustrations could be clearer for drawer glide direction and a few other parts. Once assembled the cabinets are solid and don't wobble at all. I didn't install the anti-tip that prevents both drawers being opened at the same time because of the video with the clicking sound but no kids ever come in my office. Drawers line up perfectly with some common sense adjustments if needed during assembly. Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report Starry Nights 4.0 out of 5 stars Does not fit two rows of letter front to back and Dark Color, Very Black not bright Red-ish Cherry Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021 Color: Bing Cherry Pattern Name: Cabinet Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded. First of all, this is engineered wood, not solid wood. The bottom of the drawers and the back of the cabinet are particle board. For the price, it is pretty enough, and functional. However, you cannot fit two rows of letter size folders front to back - you can have one front to back, with the others sideways (see video). You can move the center rail to accommodate legal size going front to back, and letter sideways. The actual inside dimensions are 22.5 inches long,  12 inches wide and 9.25 inches deep (inside). The drawer depth is less than the front panel depth. When I close the door, the mechanism that prevents both doors from being opened at the same time clicks, and if I stop pushing the cabinet in at that point, the door is flush with the sides, but sticks out at the top and bottom. You give it one more push and it is where it should be located. I tried showing this in the video, and two photos. The rails are plastic. One thing that concerns me is that the front door is attached to the drawer pieces with a plastic part - see photo of inside drawer corner. My father says plastic can be strong. Time will tell. The drawers do come with one stop for each drawer, to prevent them from coming all the way out. The drawers open easily, and the drawer sliders (rails) are all metal. They are greased, so I got some grease on me during assembly. Had to wash my hands several times to prevent grease from getting on the cabinet while I put on the drawer sliders. One pleasant surprise is that the unit comes with one furniture anchor (see photo with orange bag), that has one zip tie and a butterfly (?) bolt. Because it is engineered wood, one of the side front posts already is damaged. I have contacted the manufacturer for a replacement, which was sent quickly. I didn’t use glue where the dowels are placed (the instructions don’t say to use glue); therefore, I was able to take it apart again and replace the damaged front leg without having to remove the back; but I did have to take out both drawers. You must be very careful not to damage the wood while assembling the cabinet. The assembly instructions were pretty clear, and they have about 3 online YouTube videos to watch assembly of the cam and bolts. I am familiar with using this type of connections, so assembly was pretty straight forward. It lacks advice about keeping the slide rails straight, so I used a square (not included), and there is a little room for error here. If you keep the rails square, the drawers are pretty level when done. I used a level (not included) to get the front drawers into alignment- I only had to adjust the bottom drawer by about 1/8 or less inches on one side. You adjust by unscrewing the plastic part (see photo), moving the front panel slightly, and tightening the screws again. As for the color, I am disappointed. There is a photo of the color of the cabinet, but it’s actually darker than the photo shows. It has a lot of black, and is very dark. It’s not the color I wanted. The color I wanted is a more red- ish color. Overall, it’s nice enough for the price, and I will use it. It leaves me wanting a real all solid wood cabinet, one that is a different color - bright red Cherry and one that is longer, so you can have 2 rows of files front to back. From advice I have seen, people recommend that you do not paint engineered wood, because it can’t be sanded.

Sturdy Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2023 Color: Washed Gray Pattern Name: Cabinet Verified Purchase The media could not be loaded. The only thing I don’t like about this is the loud clicking noise the anti-tipping thingee makes when you open the drawers. It’s well made. I put it together all by myself (even though it says in some parts that you should have a “team”). The instructions are perfect all the way up until you have to take the drawer pulls off and screw them on the drawers themselves. I had to watch the video because it doesn’t tell you what to do. Other than that the instructions are super easy to follow. Read more Jen 5.0 out of 5 stars Very heavy.

Je suis très satisfaite de cet achat tant par son apparence que par sa fonctionnalité. Je craignais qu'il ne soit un peu fragile selon les commentaires que j'avais lu et effectivement, les fonds de tiroirs sont minces mais c'est une filière alors cela m’indiffère. Le reste est tout à fait honorable. J'ai l'ai assemblé seule, en 2 heures, en suivant le plan à la lettre.

I just moved into a new apartment and have limited space and this was perfect to fit in the corner of my living room. I haven't really organized it yet, just threw books on it for this photo. I imagine as I add more books, I'll probably mount it on the wall but for now it works as is. It took me probably an hour and a half to assemble and I only had one hiccup when it came to adding the last back panel. There are videos to assist you online which was nice. All the pieces necessary to assemble were included. This is ideal for limited space and if you want something a bit different than a traditional bookshelf.

Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024 Color: Grey Verified Purchase I recently re-did the spare bedroom to turn it into a home office/hobby room.  I had a weird little spot in the room that needed something but not much would fit there.  This was the problem solver!  I got into the Sarah Maas books and it holds all of her current books perfectly and looks absolutely adorable while doing so. Easy to assemble, light weight and holds a lot. Her books are huge and I could fit all of them on there.  If you have a bunch of regular sized books, this could hold a TON.  It's not super tall, either.  I'm 5'5 and it comes to just under my chest. Perfect little bookcase to keep a series together or to fill in an empty space.

Great for small spaces, but still fits plenty of books as you can see in my picture. Height-wise, I’m just shy of 5’4” and it comes up to about my underbust. We did not do the wall anchor thing, and it is a *tad* wobbly at times even with heavier books at the bottom. But still decently sturdy & good quality, especially for the price. This took my husband about an hour to assemble, but said once got the pattern it made sense. His critique is that the instructions weren’t as clear as he prefers and there were a lot of extra parts, so it was a little confusing. But he also didn’t want to watch the reviewer assembly tips video, sooo 🤷🏻‍♀️ Read more Sara 4.0 out of 5 stars Cute & study little book tree Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023 I was looking for an affordable bookshelf that wouldn’t be too large or bulky for the limited available space in my living room - and this was perfect! Great for small spaces, but still fits plenty of books as you can see in my picture. Height-wise, I’m just shy of 5’4” and it comes up to about my underbust. We did not do the wall anchor thing, and it is a *tad* wobbly at times even with heavier books at the bottom. But still decently sturdy & good quality, especially for the price. This took my husband about an hour to assemble, but said once got the pattern it made sense.

I did not use the wall anchor because my computer/craft room does not get much traffic and we don't have small kids.  However, since I bought two of these, I placed them side by side and I used some heavy books to straddle the two lower boxes/bases.  This both makes the stands more stable and serves as a horizontal shelf for these oversized books. I would prefer that these were real wood not compressed boards that are covered with wood-grain cover.  That's my only negative comment.

For normal books it would be fine, but I bought this for homeschooling, so the textbooks hang over quite a bit. It did however hold all of it and didn't break, so I can't complain. Super cute, space effective, and sturdy as long as you have it anchored to the wall or put heavy stuff in the bottom shelf (I put my teacher keys). I would buy again, even knowing what I know.

Mary Lou McBride 5.0 out of 5 stars Convertible chair to bed Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024 Color: Light Blue Verified Purchase The order arrived ahead of time which was a nice surprise. It was very easy to assemble and exceeds our expectations. Perfect chair for reading and comfortable and spacious as a bed for granddaughter’s sleepovers. Great value for the price and the upholstery is a pretty color and texture.  Almost effortless to convert from chair to bed and bed to chair.

It’s practical because it can be an ottoman or a day bed in an office. It’s small enough but large enough to sleep in comfortably. This is my favorite purchase of 2024!! I’ll be buying another one for the master bedroom. I’m so so happy with this!!! Read more 2 people found this helpful Helpful Report Freeze Dat! 4.0 out of 5 stars Easy to assemble Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024 Color: Light Blue Verified Purchase This sleeper sofa  is a great space-saving option for small apartments, dorm rooms or home offices. While it performs well as a compact loveseat or ottoman during the day, it easily folds out to a single bed for overnight guests. The light blue upholstery has a modern, clean-lined look that will fit into most decor styles. It also has adjustable backrests and armrests for customizable comfort while seating two. As with many futon-style couch beds, this one is quite firm and not the most cushiony seat. However, for the price and versatility in a tight space, it's difficult to beat. The fold-out mattress is comfortable enough for one person to sleep on. Overall, this 4-in-1 futon couch/ottoman/loveseat  is a practical furniture piece that saves space without compromising functionality. Its transformable design makes it suitable for small living quarters like apartments, dorms or home offices.

Very heavy when it arrived but overall, great quality fabric, sturdy, & very easy to assemble. I would recommend using a power drill to attach wheels. There are guide marking & some starter holes but they are sort of misleading. Best option is to use your better judgment & use a drill for all 4 holes.

I always try things before I ask my guests to sleep on them. I had to get up in the middle of the night and go back to my normal bed because this was so hard. I then bought a foam pad to see if that helped. It did not. It is a rock. Maybe you could nap for 10 mins, but definitely don't expect to be able to sleep on it. Maybe little kids can because they can sleep on a pile of legos, but normal human adults cannot.  I tried to return it, but got a ton of pushback, offered to drop it at the place they told me to ship it to and they said I could not do that; that I had to ship it, even though it's only a few miles away.  Eventually agreed to get $50 off the cost, but I don't think I ever got that credit, so I'm gathering the energy to try and at least get that promised credit. Really think twice about this. I did end up buying a nice little fold out pad that just lays on the floor and is actually comfortable (I tried it).  Bummer because it looks like a good idea.

Prime members can score all kinds of amazing deals, but you’ll have to be quick. Not a member? Sign up for a free 30-day trial to unlock exclusive deals. Shark IZ363HT Cordless Vacuum Amazon $350 $230 at Amazon LIVE: 65 Amazon October Prime Day Deals on the Best Products We've Tested — from $4 The Shark cordless vacuum has powerful suction that you can use on carpets as well as hard floors. It’ll run for up to 50 minutes on a full charge in standard mode and its LED lights shine bright to illuminate hidden dirt and debris you may have otherwise missed. Once the dust cup is full, simply press a button to empty it into the trash. The self-cleaning brushroll has flexible silicone fins rather than bristles. Translation: You won’t have to worry about hair and pet fur getting tangled up and slowing down the device. The cordless stick vacuum also comes with a HEPA filter to reduce dust and allergens as you clean. Convert it into a handheld vacuum when you want to remove dirt from furniture and between couch cushions, or extend the wand to get into hard-to-reach spaces like tall window sills and ceiling fans. It also comes with an upholstery brush, dust brush, and crevice tool. Plus, it only weighs about 7 pounds, making it a lightweight choice that you can tote from room to room. The 14 Best Pet Hair Vacuums of 2024, Tested by Dog and Cat Owners “I have owned (and loved) two Dyson cordless vacuums, but saw this on Black Friday sale when my Dyson broke… This Shark is hands down far more superior,” one shopper said thanks in part to its “useful” attachments and long battery life. They finished their review by writing: “Dyson owners — you won’t regret switching to Shark.” “It slurps up dog hair like crazy and doesn't get tangled in the brushroller,” another customer added . “It doesn't scatter any dirt like other brands. The suction power is so strong, nothing escapes it.” If you’ve been meaning to upgrade to a stick vacuum that can handle pet fur and other debris, now’s the time. Pick up the Shark IZ363HT Cordless Vacuum while it’s on sale, then keep scrolling for more discounted floor cleaners.

Shopping Home Products My Mom Still Uses Her 5+ Year-Old Pyrex Food Storage Containers, so I’m Eyeing This Similar Set Plus it’s on sale for Amazon Prime members By Maggie Horton Maggie Horton Maggie Horton is a shopping writer for PEOPLE with a background in print journalism and digital media. Currently, she writes about sales and hot new items in the home space, including celebrity decor collaborations and deep discounts on trusted brands like Dyson and Vitamix. People Editorial Guidelines Published on October 7, 2024 06:30AM EDT Photo: People; Amazon; Maggie Horton Pyrex has been my family’s go-to brand for glassware for generations, so I’m eyeing a new set of food storage containers for myself during Prime Big Deal Days . My mom and grandma swear by the brand’s durable glass and secure lids to store, freeze, and reheat leftovers and transport food without leaking. This different seven-piece Pyrex set comes with round, rectangular, and square containers in a variety of sizes, all with matching snap lids. Shop the top-rated pick while it’s on sale exclusively for Prime members for less than $6 apiece. Pyrex 7-Piece Glass Food Storage Containers, $38 with Prime Amazon $45 $38 at Amazon Yankee Candles Are Quietly on Sale at Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, and Prices Start at $17 I can attest to Pyrex’s stain-resistant qualities, as our glassware is still just as clear as the day it arrived, including my mom’s which is more than five years old. My mom appreciates that she can throw her lids and containers in the top or bottom rack of the dishwasher, saving valuable top-rack space. My mom explains that the locking lids provide extra peace of mind because she knows they are secure when she hears the tabs click into place on each side. Maggie Horton The set I’m buying is also designed to resist absorbing stains, odors, and flavors from food, so whatever it holds will stay fresh. Plus, the lids are made from BPA-free plastic, so they’re safe to use in the microwave, and every part of the containers can go in the dishwasher. The set comes with dry-erase labels on each lid, too, so you can label them with dates and descriptors. Similar Pyrex glassware we tried didn’t splatter soup in the microwave, either. One Amazon shopper dubbed the Pyrex glass storage vessels the “perfect containers for leftovers,” adding that they “keep food super fresh” and are “easy to clean and durable.” Another shopper noted that “the versatility of being able to freeze, dishwash, and use in the oven” makes them “super useful” for everyday use. The 6 Best Slow Cookers We Tested for Entertaining and Easy Weeknight Meals My mom and grandma’s well-loved Pyrex food storage containers have stood the test of time, so I’m confident that this similar Pyrex glass food container set will soon become a mainstay in my own kitchen.
