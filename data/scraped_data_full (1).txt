It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment.  The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.  Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA. This item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.

Made-to-order means that once we receive your order, it gets included in a production run of that item and when it is completed, it ships to you directly. This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times. Can you rush my order? We are unable to rush any made-to-order items, however from time to time we have a small stock of this lamp available on our Ready to Ship page.

Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable. Simplicity and Style Designed for durability, practicality and style.

How is my large furniture piece delivered?

For front doors that are accessed via stairs, your delivery will be taken to the ground floor only and not up any stairs. We recommend that, if possible, you have someone else available to assist you with taking the items inside your home, unpack and position your piece/s in your home. Our Premium Furniture Delivery ($179) , which is only available to metro Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane & Gold Coast service includes a 2-man delivery to your home (with items arriving un-crated and in bubble wrap and foam).

We will not post to PO post office addresses. If we foresee any delays, you will be notified via email or phone. Can I give my authority to leave the items at the time of delivery? If you wish to provide Mahlia’s carriers with the authority to leave your items when being delivered, please provide any authority to leave delivery instructions during the order checkout process. This will give the carriers the authority for your items to be left at the front door or another safe spot.

Inlay Handmade Pieces As with all things made by hand, these pieces are all unique and small flaws may be present, which adds to the intrinsic character and beauty of each piece. Care Instructions ​ To clean your bone inlay or mother of pearl inlay furniture, please wipe with a slightly damp cloth. After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth. Bone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use. Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example: https://www.bunnings.com.au/cabot-s-500ml-satin-water-based-cabothane-clear-polyurethane-varnish_p1522368 Whilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece. Please do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay. They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces. If your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration. Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun. If your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use. The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during season/weather change this could happen. Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen. For our vase products, we would recommend covering your vase base prior to using, as these vases are not 100% waterproof. Unpacking Inlay products are delicately handmade and heavy in weight, which is why our products are very carefully bubble wrapped and then packaged and bolted carefully within a crate. During the transit and customs process, our products can be moved around numerous times, and hence it is safe to package with extra precaution to eliminate any damage. When the larger furniture crate arrives at your home, you will require two tools to open the crate. This includes a crow bar and hammer, or as a third additional option you can use a cordless drill with Phillips head attachment (or a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws is a perfectly fine alternative). Here is a video displaying a simple way to open your crate: https://youtu.be/c_73cP5dFWM Additional Info About Mahlia Interiors Get in Contact Shipping and Returns Terms and Conditions Care and Unpacking Follow us out there Facebook Pinterest Instagram Email More options Payment Plans Gift Vouchers Afterpay We love to talk Inlay info@mahliainteriors.com.au Apple Pay Google Pay Mastercard Shop Pay Union Pay Visa Copyright ©

Shipping calculated at checkout Quantity: Decrease quantity Increase quantity Add to cart Share Share Share Facebook Pinterest Twitter E-mail Description We love the beauty of natural oak, but does your space crave a little more drama? Meet the Linea! If your room is swimming in white oak, this collection is here to spice things up with bold oak strip panels and soft-closing doors that reveal a sleek black interior—because why should the outside have all the fun? On the flip side, are you looking for something more subtle? The Linea also comes in all-natural oak or all-black oak for those who prefer their drama with a side of calm. Either way, your space is about to get a whole lot more interesting! Dimensions: W159 D45 H76.1CM The Timber Wood displays different grain patterns depending on which way they are cut - for example, the 'medullary ray' which can appear on oak furniture is a mark of good quality timber, these are just characteristics of the natural beauty of the wood. Wood veneers also allow distinctive patterns to be created on some surfaces, such as table tops and drawer fronts by the way slivers are arranged. All timber and veneer surfaces will change colour and mellow over time. New furniture will initially vary in shade from items that have been previously purchased.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Several shades of appealing colors in modern and abstract designs bring a splash of newness to your home. The machine-woven technique offers durability, making it well suited for both low and high traffic areas. Woven of high quality polypropylene, this area rug will continue to look dazzling over the years. The soft feel of the fibers is incredibly comfortable underfoot and embraces a cozy home feeling. Decorative modern & abstract design, ideal for any room Machine woven with high quality polypropylene Soft to the touch & comfortable medium pile height Finishes your living space beautifully without overpowering Ideal pile density to withstand foot traffic & easy to clean Care Instructions Regular care is essential to the longevity of your rug. Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It’s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it’s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.

Additionally, the majority of furniture and accessories returned are not packaged to original factory standards or incur damage during transit. Because we provide our customers free standard shipping many items and absorb that cost, we must assess restocking fees on returns to account for the quantity of returned items that cannot be accepted or resold.

I love my chairs they are exactly as shown in the advertisement and very comfy. Would highly recommend purchasing from this company. Claire C. (Verified Buyer) WHY "ONLY DINING CHAIRS" ARE DIFFERENT? We believe in the quality of our products, which is why, unlike other furniture retailers, we offer exclusive 5 year warranties for chairs, bar stools and tables in residential settings. We feel that we would be doing a “dis service” to the Australian public if we didn’t stand by our products and give you a 5 year warranty when most furniture retailers will only give you 1 to 2 years. Not to mention we offer regular wear and tear coverage on all chairs and bar stools which is a first for any Australia retailer. If you are dissatisfied with what you receive (though we doubt it!), we’ll give you a full refund - no questions asked. SHOP DINING CHAIRS NOW → 5 Year Warranty Regular Wear & Tear

Pride in Bench-Built Craftsmanship Our painted furniture is the best in class. Our builders hand-select each piece of wood that makes it into a Maine Cottage piece of furniture. Every chair, bed, and dresser—each is built one at a time start to finish at a single workbench by a single craftsman who has complete ownership and pride in the finished result. Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish. Read More About Our QUality Why We Shine The sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style.

Why  Amazonas? Over 30 years ago our founder Matthias traveled through South America in a canoe, sleeping in a hammock he made with the help of the Huaorani Indian tribe. It transformed his experience and gave him the rest he needed to travel through the dense rainforest, and avoid being bitten by the many critters that roamed the forest floors. Returning to Germany he began to sell hammocks to his friends and family. Eventually, demand grew and now Amazonas is recognised as one of the best manufacturers of hammocks in the world with factories in South America and around Europe. All our hammocks are now made by skilled experts using only the best materials, which is why we are the only hammock manufacturer to carry the GS Quality and TUV Safety marks, which recognise the exceptional safety and quality of what we do.

I can't speak highly enough of this company and would recommend the hammock without reservation. Jon M The products are really well made and very sturdy.

We celebrate both of these here at Modern Furniture. We travel the world looking for beautiful decor, with a range of timeless pieces crafted from quality materials. Browse our exclusive collection today. So Which is the Right Style of Furniture for You? It really depends on your personal taste and the overall aesthetic you're going for.

A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. “When she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson – Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.” The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view. Fabrication Made using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request. The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt’s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.

Once dispatched, delivery typically occurs within 2-3 days, applicable only for mainland UK. Cancellation/Returns Furniture that is bespoke made to order is not subject to distance selling regulations and is therefore non-returnable.

Any changes from this standard must be arranged in advance. While our drivers are keen to assist, please note that if they need to enter your home, we cannot be held responsible for any incidental damages to your property. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that the front door is of a sufficient size for the item to pass through. Should the furniture not fit through the door, and the customer wishes to return it, the customer will be responsible for a return cost of £60. Additionally, a 25% restocking fee will apply. Our drivers are generally more than willing to help you place the item inside your home, provided it does not pose a risk to their well-being or to the safety of your property. Kindly understand that all final delivery decisions are at the discretion of the driver. FAULTY AND DAMAGED ITEMS All our items are handmade to order, then thoroughly checked and carefully wrapped before dispatch.

Our wood is select-logged and low waste. Fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging. FSC® Certified Timber FSC® certified, which stands for the Forest Stewardship Council®, is a certification system co-founded by WWF (World Wildlife Fund).  An FSC® chain of custody means that the timber comes from a forest that is responsibly managed. Trees in the certified forests are grown and harvested according to a strict set of guidelines that benefit the environment. All of the wood we use at Totem Road comes with a fully documented chain of custody of the journey from the forest to the furniture that ends up in your homes. 100% Sustainable Oak Not only is oak incredibly durable and long-lasting, each piece is unique in its grain and finish. Our wood is select-logged to support regeneration, biodiversity and the protection of native fauna. Every last piece of wood is utilised in our manufacturing and as a result, we have some of the lowest wastage percentages in the industry. Conscious Packaging Our commitment to sustainability is seen throughout the entire process from factory to furniture, including how our pieces arrive to your homes. Totem Road is securely packed in fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging and won’t contribute to landfill or harm the environment. It comes at a cost to us, but cheaper petrochemical-based packaging such as polystyrene, has a large manufacturing footprint, contains toxic substances and has little to no biodegradability.

BAGDAD PORTABLE LAMP Originally designed in 1954, the Bagdad Lamp is a brilliantly offbeat showcase of Mathieu Matégot’s material affinity with perforated metal.

NEW COLOR EDIT FOR MULTI-LITE PORTABLE LAMP Loved for its futuristic looks and configurable shade, Louis Weisdorf’s iconic Multi-Lite is one of the most recognizable lighting collections of the 20th century. GUBI’s introduction of the Multi-Lite Portable brought new degrees of versatility to what was already one of the most flexible lamps available. Now, the Muti-Lite Portable becomes more adaptable still, with a range of four new colorways and a striking high-gloss finish, giving the lamp tactility and enabling it to complement an even wider variety of settings, indoors and out. Explore BEETLE COLLECTION Strikingly simple in form but full of personality, GamFratesi’s design combines crafted details and advanced manufacturing technologies to produce something truly original: a highly versatile, extremely comfortable, and beautifully expressive chair inspired by the forms of nature. Explore PACHA LOUNGE CHAIR Iconic designer Pierre Paulin’s vision was to create a sensation of ‘sitting on clouds’. A little ahead of its time in 1975, the modular Pacha Collection is finally coming into its own as GUBI reissues this timeless and characterful collection. Explore STORIES HOTEL LILOU In the historic heart of Hyères, close to France’s Mediterranean coast, the Haussmannian facade of Hotel Lilou conceals a chic and timeless interior that honors the hotel’s heyday in the early 20th century. BEETLE & BAT IN RECYCLED PLASTIC In 2013, GUBI made design history with the launch of the Beetle Chair by GamFratesi. Then five years later, it happened again with the Bat. Both inspired by nature, the designs swiftly became some of the most beloved chairs in the GUBI Collection, cherished for their flexibility, elegance, and chameleonic ability to suit any setting. Now, the story of these pioneering designs enters a new chapter, with the launch of the Beetle and Bat in recycled plastic. GUBI FOR UNICEF GUBI and UNICEF launch Young Hopes Campaign: 100% of the profits from the sale of a limited edition of 100 of Pierre Paulin’s iconic chair to support health and education for children around the world.

For international shipping details click here . Most furniture takes around 6-8 weeks to be ready to send. We will contact you when it's ready so that we can arrange a convenient delivery day. Large items will be delivered using a courier service who can bring it in to a room of choice.  Very large, heavy items will be delivered by a 2-person courier team if this service is available to your postcode. Courier delivery unfortunately isn't available to Northern Ireland, some remote postcodes in Wales, Scotland and England or any offshore addresses. For areas not covered by our courier we can package your order on a pallet and ship it with a parcel service. This will incur a surcharge starting at £40 for smaller furniture items. This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message here if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode. Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes. We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you. This usually costs £35. Please remember to provide a contact telephone number at checkout. All couriers require this and without it, we can't send your furniture!

To see the shipping cost add a product to your cart and then use the shipping calculator at the bottom of the Cart page. You can remove it from your Cart at any time.

Just message us with the product/size you're looking for and we'll get back to you with a price. Items will be sent with an international delivery company (usually UPS, TNT/Fedex or DHL). Unfortunately we can't arrange delivery on a specific day but we will send tracking details as soon as it has been dispatched. You will then be able to contact the delivery company to schedule/reschedule delivery. Delivery takes 3-10 days from the day of dispatch depending on your location and custom clearance times. Delivery is to the street door, so ensure you have someone available to help if you are ordering a large, heavy item.
